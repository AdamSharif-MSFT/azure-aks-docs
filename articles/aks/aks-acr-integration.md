# Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service

When you're using Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), an authentication mechanism needs to be established. This article details the recommended configurations for authentication between these two Azure services.

You can set up the AKS to ACR authentication with the Azure CLI.  See [AKS with Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-create) for information on using the Azure CLI with AKS.

## Before you begin

* You must currently be an **owner** of the **Azure subscription** to assign the appropriate roles required for the service principal
* You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.70 or later
* [docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your client, and access to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Create a new AKS cluster with ACR integration

You can set up AKS and ACR integration during the initial creation of your AKS cluster.  The following CLI command creates an ACR in the resource group you specify with **acrpull** permissions. If the *acr-name* does not exist, a default ACR name of `aks-<cluster-name>-acr` is automatically created.  Supply valid values for your parameters below.
```
az aks create -n <your-kubernetes-cluster-name> -g <your-resource-group> -enable-acr [--acr-name <your-acr-name>]
```

Optionally, you can also specify **acr-resource-id** instead of **acr-name** with the following command.  Supply your valid values for the parameters below.
```
az aks create -n <your-Kubernetes-cluster-name>  -g <your-resource-group> --enable-acr [--acr-resource-id <your-acr-resource-id>]
```

## Create ACR integration for existing AKS clusters

For exisitng AKS clusters you can add integration with an existing ACR. The following commans do <TODO>  You must supply valid values for **acr-name** and **acr-resource-id** or the commands will fail.
```
az aks update -n <your-kubernetes-cluster-name> -g <your-resource-group> --enable-acr --acr-name <your-acr-name>
az aks create -n <your-kubernetes-cluster-name> -g <your-resource-group> --enable-acr --acr-resource-id <your-acr-resource-id>
```

## Verify the AKS and ACR integration
Ensure you have created and AKS cluster and added the ACR integration with the steps above.

Remove and update the AKS CLI preview extenstion
```
az extension remove --name aks-preview 
az extension add -y --name aks-preview
```

Login to your ACR
```
az acr login -n <your-acr-name>
```

Pull an image from docker hub
```
docker pull nginx
```

Tag the image
```
docker tag nginx $acrloginservername/nginx:v1
```

Push the docker image to ACR
```
docker push someacr1.azurecr.io/nginx:v1
```

Credentials heading TODO
```
az aks get-credentials -g <your-resource-group> -n <your-kubernetes-cluster-name>
```

Update the state
```
kubectl apply -f acr-nginx.yaml
```

Verify pods, you should see 2 with a status of running
```
kubectl get pods
```

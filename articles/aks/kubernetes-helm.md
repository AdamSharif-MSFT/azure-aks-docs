# Use Helm to deploy application on a Kubernetes cluster 

[Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/) is an open-source packaging tool that helps you install and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications. Similar to Linux package managers such as Apt-get and Yum, Helm is used to manage Kubernetes charts, which are packages of preconfigured Kubernetes resources.

This document steps through configuring and using helm in a Kubernetes cluster on AKS.

## Before you begin

The steps detailed in this document assume that you have created an AKS Kubernetes cluster and have established a kubectl connection with the cluster. If you need these items see, the [AKS Kubernetes quickstart](./kubernetes-walkthrough.md).

## Install Helm CLI

The Helm CLI is a client that runs on your development system and allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm charts. 

To install the Helm CLI on a Mac use `brew`. For additional installation options see, [Installing Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md).
 
```bash
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

Output:

```bash
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/kubernetes-helm-2.6.2.sierra.bottle.1.tar.gz
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Pouring kubernetes-helm-2.6.2.sierra.bottle.1.tar.gz

  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
==> Summary

```

## Configure Helm Tiller

Tiller is a server-side component that runs on the Kubernetes cluster. Tiler manages the lifecycle of Kubernetes applications that have been run using Helm charts. 

Tiller is pre-installed on Kubernetes clusters in Azure, however the [helm init](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-init) command can be used to validate that Tiller is running the latest version. 

The [helm init](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-init) command is also used to connect the Helm CLI with the Kubernetes cluster using a Kubernetes configuration file.

```bash
helm init --upgrade
```

Output:

```bash
$HELM_HOME has been configured at /Users/neilpeterson/.helm.
Warning: Tiller is already installed in the cluster.
(Use --client-only to suppress this message, or --upgrade to upgrade Tiller to the current version.)
Happy Helming!
```

## Find Helm charts 

Helm charts are used to deploy applications into a Kubernetes cluster. To search for pre-created Helm charts, use the [helm search](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-search) command.

```bash 
helm search 
```

The output looks similar to, however with many more charts.

```bash

stable/datadog               	0.8.0  	DataDog Agent  
```

To update the list charts, use the [helm repo update](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-repo-update) command.

```bash 
helm repo update 
```

Output:

```bash
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Skip local chart repository
...Successfully got an update from the "stable" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈ Happy Helming!⎈ 
```

## Deploy a Helm chart 
 
To deploy a Nginx ingress controller chart, use the [helm install](https://docs.helm.sh/helm/#helm-install) command.

```bash
helm install stable/nginx-ingress 
```

The output looks similar to the following however include much more information including instructions on how to use the Kubernetes deployment.

```bash

```

## List installed Helm charts

To see a list of charts installed on your cluster, type:

```bash
helm list 
```

Output:

```bash
NAME         	REVISION	UPDATED                 	STATUS  	CHART              	NAMESPACE
bilging-ant  	1       	Thu Oct  5 00:11:11 2017	DEPLOYED	nginx-ingress-0.8.7	default 
```

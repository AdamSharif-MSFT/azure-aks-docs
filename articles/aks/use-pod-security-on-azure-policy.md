# Preview - Secure pods using Azure Policy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

To improve the security of your AKS cluster, you can limit what pods can be scheduled and audit for anything running against policy. You define this access using specific policies enabled by the [Azure Policy Add-on](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md). This article shows you how to use Azure Policy to limit the deployment of pods in AKS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> AKS preview features are self-service opt-in. Previews are provided "as-is" and "as available" and are excluded from the service level agreements and limited warranty. AKS Previews are partially covered by customer support on best effort basis. As such, these features are not meant for production use. For additional information, please see the following support articles:

> * [Azure Support FAQ][aks-faq]

## Before you begin

This article assumes that you have an existing AKS cluster. If you need an AKS cluster, see the AKS quickstart [using the Azure CLI][aks-quickstart-cli] or [using the Azure portal][aks-quickstart-portal].

### Install the Azure Policy Add-on for AKS

To secure AKS pods through Azure Policy, you need to install the Azure Policy Add-on for AKS. Follow these [steps to install the Azure Policy Add-on](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#install-azure-policy-add-on-for-aks).

Ensure you have the following which are instructed in the walk-through linked above.

* Registered the `AKS-AzurePolicyAutoApprove` preview feature flag
* Azure CLI installed with the `aks-preview` extension version 0.4.53 or greater
* An AKS cluster on a supported version of 1.15 or greater installed with the Azure Policy Add-on

## Overview of securing pods through Azure Policy

In a Kubernetes cluster, an admission controller is used to intercept requests to the API server when a resource is to be created. The admission controller can then *validate* the resource request against a set of rules, or *mutate* the resource to change deployment parameters.

Previously, a feature called pod security policy was enabled through the Kubernetes project to support the protection of what pods can be deployed by provisioning a dedicated admission controller. By using Azure Policy for Kubernetes, an AKS cluster can instrument a set of built-in Azure policies which support securing pods and more.

The policy language used by Azure Policy for Kubernetes is built on the open-source Open Policy Agent which relies on Rego and is [explained further here](../governance/policy/concepts/policy-for-kubernetes.md#policy-language).

This document covers the scenarios of using Azure Policy to secure pods similar to what was enabled through pod security policies.

## Enable policies on an AKS cluster that target pod security

After installing the Azure Policy Add-on, no policies are applied by default. You can select from built-in policies to be audited or enforced against a given AKS cluster.

### Use built-in initiatives

### Build a custom initiative

## Create a test user to validate the policy

By default, when you use the [az aks get-credentials][az-aks-get-credentials] command, the *admin* credentials for the AKS cluster are added to your `kubectl` config. The admin user bypasses the enforcement of pod security policies. If you use Azure Active Directory integration for your AKS clusters, you could sign in with the credentials of a non-admin user to see the enforcement of policies in action. In this article, let's create a test user account in the AKS cluster that you can use.

Create a sample namespace named *psp-aks* for test resources using the [kubectl create namespace][kubectl-create] command. Then, create a service account named *nonadmin-user* using the [kubectl create serviceaccount][kubectl-create] command:

```console
kubectl create namespace psp-aks
kubectl create serviceaccount --namespace psp-aks nonadmin-user
```

Next, create a RoleBinding for the *nonadmin-user* to perform basic actions in the namespace using the [kubectl create rolebinding][kubectl-create] command:

```console
kubectl create rolebinding \
    --namespace psp-aks \
    psp-aks-editor \
    --clusterrole=edit \
    --serviceaccount=psp-aks:nonadmin-user
```

### Create alias commands for admin and non-admin user

To highlight the difference between the regular admin user when using `kubectl` and the non-admin user created in the previous steps, create two command-line aliases:

* The **kubectl-admin** alias is for the regular admin user, and is scoped to the *psp-aks* namespace.
* The **kubectl-nonadminuser** alias is for the *nonadmin-user* created in the previous step, and is scoped to the *psp-aks* namespace.

Create these two aliases as shown in the following commands:

```console
alias kubectl-admin='kubectl --namespace psp-aks'
alias kubectl-nonadminuser='kubectl --as=system:serviceaccount:psp-aks:nonadmin-user --namespace psp-aks'
```

## Test the creation of a privileged pod

Let's first test what happens when you schedule a pod with the security context of `privileged: true`. This security context escalates the pod's privileges. In the previous section that showed the default AKS pod security policies, the *privilege* policy should deny this request.

Create a file named `nginx-privileged.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-privileged
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-privileged
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
```

Create the pod using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-privileged.yaml
```

The pod fails to be scheduled, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-privileged.yaml

Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "nginx-privileged.yaml": pods "nginx-privileged" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: []
```

The pod doesn't reach the scheduling stage, so there are no resources to delete before you move on.

## Test creation of an unprivileged pod

In the previous example, the pod specification requested privileged escalation. This request is denied by the default *privilege* pod security policy, so the pod fails to be scheduled. Let's try now running that same NGINX pod without the privilege escalation request.

Create a file named `nginx-unprivileged.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-unprivileged
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-unprivileged
      image: nginx:1.14.2
```

Create the pod using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-unprivileged.yaml
```

The pod fails to be scheduled, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-unprivileged.yaml

Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "nginx-unprivileged.yaml": pods "nginx-unprivileged" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: []
```

The pod doesn't reach the scheduling stage, so there are no resources to delete before you move on.

## Test creation of a pod with a specific user context

In the previous example, the container image automatically tried to use root to bind NGINX to port 80. This request was denied by the default *privilege* pod security policy, so the pod fails to start. Let's try now running that same NGINX pod with a specific user context, such as `runAsUser: 2000`.

Create a file named `nginx-unprivileged-nonroot.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-unprivileged-nonroot
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx-unprivileged
      image: nginx:1.14.2
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 2000
```

Create the pod using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-unprivileged-nonroot.yaml
```

The pod fails to be scheduled, as shown in the following example output:

```console
$ kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-unprivileged-nonroot.yaml

Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating "nginx-unprivileged-nonroot.yaml": pods "nginx-unprivileged-nonroot" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: []
```

The pod doesn't reach the scheduling stage, so there are no resources to delete before you move on.

## Allow user account to use the custom pod security policy

In the previous step, you created a pod security policy to reject pods that request privileged access. To allow the policy to be used, you create a *Role* or a *ClusterRole*. Then, you associate one of these roles using a *RoleBinding* or *ClusterRoleBinding*.

For this example, create a ClusterRole that allows you to *use* the *psp-deny-privileged* policy created in the previous step. Create a file named `psp-deny-privileged-clusterrole.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: psp-deny-privileged-clusterrole
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - extensions
  resources:
  - podsecuritypolicies
  resourceNames:
  - psp-deny-privileged
  verbs:
  - use
```

Create the ClusterRole using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f psp-deny-privileged-clusterrole.yaml
```

Now create a ClusterRoleBinding to use the ClusterRole created in the previous step. Create a file named `psp-deny-privileged-clusterrolebinding.yaml` and paste the following YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: psp-deny-privileged-clusterrolebinding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: psp-deny-privileged-clusterrole
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Group
  name: system:serviceaccounts
```

Create a ClusterRoleBinding using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl apply -f psp-deny-privileged-clusterrolebinding.yaml
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the first step of this article, the pod security policy feature was enabled on the AKS cluster. The recommended practice was to only enable the pod security policy feature after you've defined your own policies. This is the stage where you would enable the pod security policy feature. One or more custom policies have been defined, and user accounts have been associated with those policies. Now you can safely enable the pod security policy feature and minimize problems caused by the default policies.

## Test the creation of an unprivileged pod again

With your custom pod security policy applied and a binding for the user account to use the policy, let's try to create an unprivileged pod again. Use the same `nginx-privileged.yaml` manifest to create the pod using the [kubectl apply][kubectl-apply] command:

```console
kubectl-nonadminuser apply -f nginx-unprivileged.yaml
```

The pod is successfully scheduled. When you check the status of the pod using the [kubectl get pods][kubectl-get] command, the pod is *Running*:

```
$ kubectl-nonadminuser get pods

NAME                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-unprivileged   1/1     Running   0          7m14s
```

This example shows how you can create custom pod security policies to define access to the AKS cluster for different users or groups. The default AKS policies provide tight controls on what pods can run, so create your own custom policies to then correctly define the restrictions you need.

Delete the NGINX unprivileged pod using the [kubectl delete][kubectl-delete] command and specify the name of your YAML manifest:

```console
kubectl-nonadminuser delete -f nginx-unprivileged.yaml
```

## Clean up resources

To disable Azure Policy for Kubernetes, use the [az aks disable-addons][az-aks-disable-addons] command.

```azure-cli
# Log in first with az login if you're not using Cloud Shell

az aks disable-addons --addons azure-policy --name MyAKSCluster --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

## Next steps

This article showed you how to create a pod security policy to prevent the use of privileged access. There are lots of features that a policy can enforce, such as type of volume or the RunAs user. For more information on the available options, see the [Kubernetes pod security policy reference docs][kubernetes-policy-reference].

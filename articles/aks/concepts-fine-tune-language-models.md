# Concepts - Customizing language models for AI and machine learning workflows

In this article, you learn about customizing language models, including some common methods and how applying the results to your models can improve the performance of your AI and machine learning workflows on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Pre-trained language models

*Pre-trained language models* offer an accessible way to get started with AI inferencing and are widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Pre-trained language models are trained on large-scale text corpora from the internet using deep neural networks and can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for specific tasks.

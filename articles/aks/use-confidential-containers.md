# Confidential Containers (preview) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

To help secure and protect your container workloads from untrusted or potentially malicious code, as part of our Zero trust cloud architecture, AKS includes Confidential Containers (preview) on Azure Kubernetes Service. Confidential Containers is based on Kata Confidential Containers to encrypt container memory, and prevent data in memory during computation from being in clear text, readable format. Together with [Pod Sandboxing][pod-sandboxing-overview], you can run sensitive workloads at this isolation level in Azure to achieve the following security goals:

* Helps application owners protect data by enforcing application security requirements (for example, deny access to Azure tenant admin, Kubernetes admin, etc).
* Help protects your data from Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)

Together with other security measures or data protection controls, as part of your overall architecture, helps you meet regulatory, industry, or governance compliance requirements for securing sensitive information.

This article helps you understand this new feature, and how to implement and configure the following:

* Deploy or upgrade an AKS cluster using the Azure CLI
* Create an Microsoft Entra ID workload identity and Kubernetes service account.
* Configure the managed identity for token federation.
* Grant access to the Azure Key Vault Managed HSM and secret
* Configure an application to be deployed as a Confidential container.

## Supported scenarios

Confidential Containers (preview) are appropriate for deployment scenarios that involve sensitive data, for instance, personally identifiable information (PII) or any data with strong security needed for regulatory compliance. Some examples of common scenarios with containers are:

- Privacy preserving big data analytics using Apache Spark analytics job for fraud pattern recognition in the financial sector.
- Running self-hosted GitHub runners to secure code signing as part of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) DevOps practices.
- Machine Learning inferencing and training of ML models, using an encrypted data set from a trusted source and only decrypting inside a confidential container environment, for purposes of privacy preserving ML inference.
- Building big data clean rooms for ID matching as part of multi-party computation in industries like retail with digital advertising.
- Building confidential computing zero trust landing zones to meet privacy regulations for application migrations to cloud.

## Prerequisites

- The Azure CLI version 2.44.1 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version, and run `az upgrade` to upgrade the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

- The `aks-preview` Azure CLI extension version 0.5.123 or later.
- 
- The `ConfCom` Confidential Container Security Policy Generator Azure CLI extension 2.62.2 or later.

- Register the `Preview` feature in your Azure subscription.

- AKS supports Confidential Containers (preview) on version 1.25.0 and higher.

- To create a Microsoft Entra ID workload identity and configure a federated identity credential, see their [Preqequisites][entra-id-workload-identity-prerequisites] for role assignment.

- The identity you're using to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more information about access and identity for AKS, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][cluster-access-and-identity-options].

- To manage a Kubernetes cluster, use the Kubernetes command-line client [kubectl][kubectl]. Azure Cloud Shell comes with `kubectl`. You can install kubectl locally using the [az aks install-cli][az-aks-install-cmd] command.

- An [Azure Key Vault Managed HSM][azure-key-vault-managed-hardware-security-module] (Hardware Security Module). See [Provision and activate a Managed HSM][create-managed-hsm].

### Install the aks-preview Azure CLI extension

[!INCLUDE [preview features callout](includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

To install the aks-preview extension, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension add --name aks-preview
```

Run the following command to update to the latest version of the extension released:

```azurecli-interactive
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

### Register the KataCcIsolationPreview feature flag

Register the `KataCcIsolationPreview` feature flag by using the [az feature register][az-feature-register] command, as shown in the following example:

```azurecli-interactive
az feature register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name "KataCcIsolationPreview"
```

It takes a few minutes for the status to show *Registered*. Verify the registration status by using the [az feature show][az-feature-show] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az feature show --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --name KataCcIsolationPreview"
```

When the status reflects *Registered*, refresh the registration of the *Microsoft.ContainerService* resource provider by using the [az provider register][az-provider-register] command:

```azurecli-interactive
az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService"
```

## Limitations

The following are constraints with this preview of Confidential Containers (preview):

* List of limitation(s) - Manuel Huber can provide me with the limtitations.

## Deploy a new cluster

Create an AKS cluster using the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command and specifying the following parameters:

   * **--workload-runtime**: Specify *KataCcIsolation* to enable the Confidential Containers feature on the node pool. With this parameter, these other parameters shall satisfy the following requirements. Otherwise, the command fails and reports an issue with the corresponding parameter(s).
    * **--os-sku**: *AzureLinux*. Only the Azure Linux os-sku supports this feature in this preview release.

   The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one node in the *myResourceGroup*:

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster –kubernetes-version <1.24.0 and above> --os-sku AzureLinux --workload-runtime <kataCcIsolation> --enable-oidc-issuer --enable-workload-identity --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster. The cluster created in the previous step has a single node pool. In the next step, we add a second node pool to the cluster.

The following example adds a node pool to *myAKSCluster* with two nodes in *nodepool2* in the *myResourceGroup*:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool add --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster –-cluster-name myCluster --node-count 2 --os-sku Azurelinux SKU --node-vm-size <VM sizes capable of nested SNP VM> 
```

After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

## Deploy to an existing cluster

To use this feature with an existing AKS cluster, the following requirements must be met:

* Follow the steps to [register the KataCcIsolationPreview](#register-the-kataccisolationpreview-feature-flag) feature flag.
* Verify the cluster is running Kubernetes version 1.24.0 and higher.
* [Enable workload identity][upgrade-cluster-enable-workload-identity] on the cluster if it isn't already.

Use the following command to enable Confidential Containers (preview) by creating a node pool to host it.

1. Add a node pool to your AKS cluster using the [az aks nodepool add][az-aks-nodepool-add] command. Specify the following parameters:

   * **--resource-group**: Enter the name of an existing resource group to create the AKS cluster in.
   * **--cluster-name**: Enter a unique name for the AKS cluster, such as *myAKSCluster*.
   * **--name**: Enter a unique name for your clusters node pool, such as *nodepool2*.
   * **--workload-runtime**: Specify *kataCcIsolation* to enable the feature on the node pool. Along with the `--workload-runtime` parameter, these other parameters shall satisfy the following requirements. Otherwise, the command fails and reports an issue with the corresponding parameter(s).
     * **--os-sku**: **AzureLinux*. Only the Azure Linux os-sku supports this feature in this preview release.
   * **--node-vm-size**: Any Azure VM size that is a generation 2 VM and supports nested virtualization works. For example, [Standard_DC8as_cc_v5][DC8as-series] VMs.

   The following example adds a node pool to *myAKSCluster* with two nodes in *nodepool2* in the *myResourceGroup*:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks nodepool add --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myManagedCluster –-cluster-name myCluster --node-count 2 --os-sku Azurelinux SKU --node-vm-size <VM sizes capable of nested SNP VM> 
    ```

    After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

2. Run the [az aks update][az-aks-update] command to enable Confidential Containers (preview) on the cluster.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az aks update --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup
    ```

    After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

## Configure container

Before you configure access to the Azure Key Vault Managed HSM and secret, and deploy an application as a Confidential container, you need to complete the configuration of the workload identity. To configure the workload identity, perform the following steps described in the [Deploy and configure workload identity][deploy-and-configure-workload-identity] article:

* Retrieve the OIDC Issuer URL
* Create a managed identity
* Create Kubernetes service account
* Establish federated identity credential

1. Set an access policy for the managed identity to access the Key Vault secret using the following commands.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    export USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID="$(az identity show --resource-group "${RESOURCE_GROUP}" --name "${USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME}" --query 'clientId' -otsv)"
    ```

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az keyvault set-policy --name "${KEYVAULT_NAME}" --secret-permissions get --spn "${USER_ASSIGNED_CLIENT_ID}"
    ```

1. Configure the application to be deployed as a Confidential container (preview) by copying the following YAML file and save it as `myapplication.yml`.

    ```yml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: nginx-deployment
      labels:
        azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
    spec:
      runtimeClassName: kata-cc
      serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      replicas: 1
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          labels:
            azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
          serviceAccountName: workload-identity-sa
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            resources:
              requests:
                memory: "512Mi"
              limits:
                memory: "512Mi"
                cpu: "60m"
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          - name: SecretKeyRelease
            image: <tbd>/aasp:1
            command:
              - "/skr.sh"
            env: 
              - name: SkrSideCarArgs
                value: ewogICAiY2VydGNhY2hlIjogewogICAgICAiZW5kcG9pbnQiOiAiYW1lcmljYXMuYWNjY2FjaGUuYXp1cmUubmV0IiwKICAgICAgInRlZV90eXBlIjogIlNldlNucFZNIiwKICAgICAgImFwaV92ZXJzaW9uIjogImFwaS12ZXJzaW9uPTIwMjAtMTAtMTUtcHJldmlldyIKICAgfSAgICAgIAp9
            resources:
              requests:
                memory: "512Mi"
              limits:
                memory: "512Mi"
                cpu: "60m"
    ```

1. Generate the deployment policy by running the following command. Replace `<path to pod yaml>` with the name of the manifest saved in the previous step.

    ```bash
    az confcom katapolicygen -y <path to pod yaml>
    ```

1. Upload keys to your Managed HSM instance with key release policy (Need details)

1. Deploy the application by running the following command:

    ```bash
    Kubectl apply -f myapplication
    ```

1. To verify the application is running in isolation from parent and any other pods deployed on the cluster, run the following command. (Run command to view secrets to verify it is working from the pod).

## Cleanup

When you're finished evaluating this feature, to avoid Azure charges, clean up your unnecessary resources. If you deployed a new cluster as part of your evaluation or testing, you can delete the cluster using the [az aks delete][az-aks-delete] command.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks delete --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster 
```

If you enabled Confidential Containers (preview) on an existing cluster, you can remove the pod(s) using the [kubectl delete pod][kubectl-delete-pod] command.

```bash
kubectl delete pod pod-name
```

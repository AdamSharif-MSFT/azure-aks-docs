# Use Draft with Azure Container Service and Azure Container Registry to build and deploy an application to Kubernetes

[Draft](https://aka.ms/draft) is an open-source tool that makes it easy to develop container-based applications and deploy them to Kubernetes clusters without knowing much about Docker and Kubernetes -- or even installing them. Using tools like Draft let you and your teams focus on building the application with Kubernetes, not paying as much attention to infrastructure.

You can use Draft with any Docker image registry and any Kubernetes cluster, including locally. This tutorial shows how to use ACS with Kubernetes and ACR to create a live but secure developer pipeline in Kubernetes using Draft, and how to use Azure DNS to expose that developer pipeline for others to see at a domain.

## Prerequisites

The steps detailed in this document assume that you have created an AKS Kubernetes cluster and have established a kubectl connection with the cluster. If you need these items see, the [AKS Kubernetes quickstart](./kubernetes-walkthrough.md).

You will also need an Azure Container Registry. For instructions on deploying an ACR instance, see the [Azure Container Registry Quickstart](../container-registry/container-registry-get-started-azure-cli.md).


## Install Helm

The Helm CLI is a client that runs on your development system and allows you to start, stop, and manage applications with Helm charts. 

To install the Helm CLI on a Mac use `brew`. For additional installation options see, [Installing Helm](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md).
 
```bash
brew install kubernetes-helm
```

Output:

```bash
==> Downloading https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/kubernetes-helm-2.6.2.sierra.bottle.1.tar.gz
######################################################################## 100.0%

  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
==> Summary

```

## Install Draft

```bash
brew install draft
```

## Configure Draft

Get ACR name and login server.

```bash
az acr list --resource-group myACRInstance --query "[].{Name:name,LoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
```

Get ACR password.

```bash
az acr credential show --name <acr name> --query "passwords[0].value" --output table
```

Initialize Draft.

```bash
draft init
```

## Build and deploy an application    

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/draft
```

```bash
cd draft/examples/java/
```

```bash
draft create
```

Output:

```bash
--> Draft detected the primary language as Java with 92.205567% certainty.
--> Ready to sail
```

```bash
draft up
```

Output:

```bash
Draft Up Started: 'open-jaguar'
open-jaguar: Building Docker Image: SUCCESS ‚öì  (28.0342s)
open-jaguar: Pushing Docker Image: SUCCESS ‚öì  (7.0647s)
open-jaguar: Releasing Application: SUCCESS ‚öì  (4.5056s)
open-jaguar: Build ID: 01BW3VVNZYQ5NQ8V1QSDGNVD0S
```

## Securely view your application

Your container is now running in AKS. To view it, use the `draft connect` command, which creates a secured connection to the cluster's IP with a specific port for your application so that you can view it locally. If successful, look for the URL to connect to your app on the first line after the **SUCCESS** indicator.


```bash
draft connect
```

Output:

```
Connecting to your app...SUCCESS...Connect to your app on localhost:46143
Starting log streaming...
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
== Spark has ignited ...
>> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567
```

In the preceding example, you could type `curl -s http://localhost:46143` to receive the reply, `Hello World, I'm Java!`. When you CTRL+ or CMD+C (depending on your OS environment), the secure tunnel is torn down and you can continue iterating.

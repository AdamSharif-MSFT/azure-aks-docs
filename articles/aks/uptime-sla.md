# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Uptime SLA

When used with Availability Zones, this **optional** offering allows you to achieve 99.95% availability for the AKS cluster API server. If you do not use Availability Zones, you can achieve 99.9% availability. AKS uses master node replicas across update and fault domains to ensure SLA requirements are met.

> [!Important]
> For clusters with egress lockdown, see [limit egress traffic](limit-egress-traffic.md) to open appropriate ports for Uptime SLA.

## Region Availability

Uptime SLA is available in the following regions:

* Australia East
* Canada Central
* EAST US
* EAST US - 2
* SOUTH CENTRAL US
* WEST US2

## Prerequisites

* The Azure CLI version 2.7.0 or later

## SLA terms and conditions

Uptime SLA pricing is determined by the number of clusters, and not by the size of the clusters. You can view [Uptime SLA pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/) for more information.

## Creating a cluster with Uptime SLA

To create a new cluster with the Uptime SLA, you use the Azure CLI and the preview extension.

### Install aks-preview CLI extension

To set the cluster autoscaler settings profile, you need the *aks-preview* CLI extension version TODO or higher. Install the *aks-preview* Azure CLI extension using the [az extension add][az-extension-add] command, then check for any available updates using the [az extension update][az-extension-update] command:

```azurecli-interactive
# Install the aks-preview extension
az extension add --name aks-preview

# Update the extension to make sure you have the latest version installed
az extension update --name aks-preview
```

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```
Use the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command to create an AKS cluster. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one node. Azure Monitor for containers is also enabled using the *--enable-addons monitoring* parameter.  This operation takes several minutes to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> When creating an AKS cluster, a second resource group is automatically created to store the AKS resources. For more information see [Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/faq#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys --uptime-sla
```
After a few minutes, the command completes and returns JSON-formatted information about the cluster.

## AKS clusters without Uptime SLA

Uptime SLA is an **optional paid service.** In a service-level agreement (SLA), the provider agrees to reimburse the customer for the cost of the service if the published service level isn't met. Since AKS is free, no cost is available to reimburse for clusters not using Uptime SLA, so AKS has no formal SLA. However, AKS seeks to maintain availability of at least 99.5 percent for the Kubernetes API server.

It is important to recognize the distinction between AKS service availability, which refers to the uptime of the Kubernetes API server and the availability of your specific workload, which is running on Azure Virtual Machines. Although the API server may be unavailable if the API server is not ready, your cluster workloads running on Azure VMs can still function. [Azure Kubernetes Service SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/kubernetes-service/v1_0/) relies on the SLA for Virtual Machines. You can increase the VM availability with features like [Availability Zones][availability-zones].

For mission-critical workloads, use **Uptime SLA and Availability Zones** to increase availability for the API server of your AKS clusters.

* You can't currently add Uptime SLA to existing clusters.
* Currently, there is no way to remove Uptime SLA from an AKS cluster.  

## Next steps

Use [Availability Zones][availability-zones] to increase high availability with your AKS cluster workloads.

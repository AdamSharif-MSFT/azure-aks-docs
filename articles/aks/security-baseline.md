# Azure security baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](../security/benchmarks/overview.md), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](../security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview.md).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32877.).

**Guidance**: When you create an Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, an network security group and route table are automatically created and managed by the AKS control plane. The network security group is automatically associated with the virtual network interface cards on your nodes and the route table is associated with the virtual network subnet. Network security group rules and route tables are automatically updated as you create and expose services. You can also deploy AKS clusters into an existing Azure virtual network subnet. These Virtual Networks can have an Azure Site-to-Site VPN or Express Route connection back to your on-premises network for connectivity and security. 

In a private AKS cluster, the control plane or API server has internal IP addresses as defined in RFC1918. With the use of a private cluster, you can ensure network traffic between your API server and your node pools remains only on the private network.

The control plane or API server is in an AKS-managed Azure subscription while a customer's cluster or node pool is in the customer's subscription. The server and the cluster or node pool communicate with each other through the Azure Private Link service in the API server virtual network and a private endpoint that's exposed in the customer's AKS cluster subnet.

Network security group rules can be used to filter the flow of traffic in virtual networks to define the source and destination IP ranges, ports, and protocols that are allowed or denied access to resources such as AKS nodes. Default rules are created to allow Transport Layer security (TLS) traffic to the Kubernetes API server. AKS automatically modifies the NSG for traffic to flow appropriately as services are created with load balancers, port mappings, or ingress routes. As services are created, e.g., a Load Balancer, the Azure platform automatically configures the appropriate rules after you define any required ports and forwarding as part of your Kubernetes Service manifests. 

By default, AKS clusters have unrestricted outbound (egress) internet access. This level of network access allows running nodes and services to access external resources as needed. If you wish to restrict egress traffic, a limited number of ports and addresses must be accessible to maintain healthy cluster maintenance tasks. AKS clusters are deployed on a virtual network with the cluster having outbound dependencies on services outside of that virtual network. The service has no inbound dependencies. It is recommended to not manually configure NSG rules to filter traffic for pods in an AKS cluster. The AKS outbound dependencies are almost entirely defined with FQDNs, which don't have static addresses behind them and NSGs cannot be used to lock down the outbound traffic from an AKS cluster.

AKS offers support for Kubernetes network policies to limit network traffic between pods in an AKS cluster. Nodes are deployed into a private virtual network subnet, with no public IP addresses assigned. You can choose to allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors with network policies. 

AKS clusters use kubenet with an Azure virtual network and subnet created for the customers. AKS kubenet, nodes get an IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet with network policies. Every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly with Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI). 

A route table must exist on your cluster subnet(s) with kubenet. AKS supports bringing your own existing subnet and route table. If your custom subnet does not contain a route table, AKS creates one for you and adds rules to it throughout the cluster lifecycle. If your custom subnet contains a route table when you create your cluster, AKS acknowledges the existing route table during cluster operations and adds/updates rules accordingly for cloud provider operations.

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32878.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure the network resources being used by your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. 

For your AKS management virtual network/subnet, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. 

You may also send NSG flow logs to an Azure Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32879.).

**Guidance**: These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic SSL termination.

A web application firewall (WAF) provides an additional layer of security by filtering the incoming traffic. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a set of rules to watch for attacks like cross site scripting or cookie poisoning.

Most web applications that use HTTP or HTTPS should use Kubernetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at layer 7. Create an Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC), a Kubernetes application, which makes it possible for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) customers to leverage Azure's native Application Gateway L7 load-balancer to expose cloud software to the Internet.

You can quickly deploy and operate a microservices-based architecture in the cloud with AKS and leverage Azure API Management (API Management) to publish your microservices as APIs for internal and external consumption. 

When publishing microservices as APIs for consumption, it can be a challenge to manage the communication between the microservices and the clients that consume them. There are concerns such as authentication, authorization, throttling, caching, transformation, and monitoring.  The API Gateway pattern addresses these concerns. An API gateway serves as a front door to the microservices, decouples clients from your microservices, adds an additional layer of security, and decreases the complexity of your microservices by removing the burden of handling cross cutting concerns.

Azure API Management is a turnkey solution to solve your API gateway needs. You can quickly create a consistent and modern gateway for your microservices and publish them as APIs.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known malicious IP addresses

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32880.).

**Guidance**: For protections from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, enable DDoS Standard protection on the Virtual Network where your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) components are deployed.
Use network policies to allow or deny traffic to pods. By default, all traffic is allowed between pods within a cluster. For improved security, define rules that limit pod communication. Network policy is a Kubernetes feature that lets you control the traffic flow between pods. You can choose to allow or deny traffic based on settings such as assigned labels, namespace, or traffic port. 

The use of network policies gives a cloud-native way to control the flow of traffic. As pods are dynamically created in an AKS cluster, the required network policies can be automatically applied. Do not use Azure NSGs to control pod-to-pod traffic, use network policies instead.

### 1.5: Record network packets

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32881.).

**Guidance**: Enable network security group (NSG) flog logs for the NSGs attached to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes as well as any NSGs attached to subnets being used to protect your AKS service components (such as the management virtual network your web application firewall (WAF) is deployed to). Record the NSG flow logs into an Azure Storage Account to generate flow records. 

If required for investigating anomalous activity, enable Network Watcher packet capture.

The netstat utility can introspect a wide variety of network stats, invoked with summary output. There are many useful fields depending on the issue. One useful field in the TCP section is "failed connection attempts". This may be an indication of SNAT port exhaustion or other issues making outbound connections. A high rate of retransmitted segments (also under the TCP section) may indicate issues with packet delivery.

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32882.).

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a Azure Application Gateway with web application firewall (WAF). 

If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection or behavior analytics is not a requirement, Azure Application Gateway with WAF can be used and configured in "detection mode" to log alerts and threats, or "prevention mode" to actively block detected intrusions and attacks.

The Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) add-on allows AKS customers to leverage Azure's native Application Gateway level 7 load-balancer to expose cloud software to the Internet. AGIC monitors the Kubernetes cluster it is hosted on and continuously updates an Application Gateway, so that selected services are exposed to the Internet. 

The Ingress Controller runs in its own pod on the customer’s AKS. AGIC monitors a subset of Kubernetes Resources for changes. The state of the AKS cluster is translated to Application Gateway specific configuration and applied to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM).

### 1.7: Manage traffic to web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32883.).

**Guidance**: A web application firewall (WAF) provides an additional layer of security by filtering the incoming traffic and can be placed in front of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a set of rules used in the WAF to watch for attacks like cross site scripting or cookie poisoning.
Additionally, most web applications that use HTTP or HTTPS should use Kubernetes ingress resources and controllers, which work at layer 7. Create an Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC), a Kubernetes application, which makes it possible for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) customers to leverage Azure's native Application Gateway L7 load-balancer to expose cloud software to the Internet.

On large web applications accessed via HTTPS, the TLS termination can be handled by the Ingress resource rather than within the application itself. 
To provide automatic TLS certification generation and configuration, you can configure the Ingress resource to use providers such as Let's Encrypt. 

AKS uses network security group rules as well to filter the flow of traffic in virtual networks, These rules define the source and destination IP ranges, ports, and protocols that are allowed or denied access to resources.
  

However, to ‘limit network traffic’ between pods in your cluster, AKS offers support for Kubernetes network policies. With network policies, you can choose to allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32884.).

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups associated with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances. 

You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules within an Network Security Group (NSG). By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. 
Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

You can apply an Azure tag to node pools in your AKS cluster. Tags applied to a node pool are different than the virtual network service tags, and are applied to each node within the node pool and are persisted through upgrades. Tags are also applied to new nodes added to a node pool during scale-out operations. Adding a tag can help with tasks such as policy tracking or cost estimation.

FQDN tags can be applied to applications for ease of use in setting up application rules within an NSG. After setting the network rules, we can add an application rule using an FQDN tag, e.g.,  AzureKubernetesService that covers all needed FQDNs accessible through TCP port 443 and port 80.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32885.).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources associated with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with Azure Policy. 
Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ContainerService" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your AKS clusters. 

You may also make use of built-in policy definitions related to AKS, such as:

•	Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services

•	Enforce HTTPS ingress in Kubernetes cluster

•	Ensure services listen only on allowed ports in Kubernetes cluster

Azure Policy extends Gatekeeper v3, an admission controller webhook for Open Policy Agent (OPA), to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. Azure Policy makes it possible to manage and report on the compliance state of your Kubernetes clusters from one place. 

The add-on enacts the following functions:

•	Checks with Azure Policy service for policy assignments to the cluster.

•	Deploys policy definitions into the cluster as constraint template and constraint custom resources.

•	Reports auditing and compliance details back to Azure Policy service.

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32886.).

**Guidance**: Use tags for network security groups (NSG) and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.
Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

The Network Policy feature in Kubernetes lets you define rules for ingress and egress traffic between pods in a cluster. With network policies, you can choose to allow or deny specific network paths within the cluster based on namespaces and label selectors. These namespaces and labels can be used as descriptors for traffic configuration rules.

FQDN tags can also be used for ease of use. After setting the network rules, we'll also add an application rule using an FQDN tag, e.g., AzureKubernetesService that covers all needed FQDNs accessible through TCP port 443 and port 80.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure command-line interface (CLI) to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

### 1.11: Use automated tools to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32887.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Activity Log to monitor network resource configurations and detect changes for network resources related to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. Create alerts within Azure Monitor that will trigger when changes to critical network resources take place. It is important to note that the any entries from the AzureContainerService user in the activity logs are logged as platform actions. 
Within AKS, the master components, kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager, are provided as a managed service. Customers create and manage the nodes that run the kubelet and container runtime and deploy their applications through the managed Kubernetes API server. Customers can use Azure Monitor logs to enable and query the logs from the Kubernetes master components.

**Guidance**: Configure Diagnostic Settings to enable log collection for the Kubernetes master components in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.Azure Monitor logs works with both RBAC and non-RBAC enabled AKS clusters.

You can enable audit logs, such as 

•	kube-auditaksService: The display name in audit log for the control plane operation (from the hcpService) 

•	masterclient: The display name in audit log for MasterClientCertificate, the certificate you get from az aks get-credentials 

•	nodeclient: The display name for ClientCertificate, which is used by agent nodes

Other audit logs such as kube-audit can also be enabled.

Additionally, Azure Policy extends Gatekeeper v3, an admission controller webhook for Open Policy Agent (OPA), to apply at-scale enforcements and safeguards on your clusters in a centralized, consistent manner. 

Azure Policy makes it possible to manage and report on the compliance state of your Kubernetes clusters from one place. The add-on enacts the following functions:

**Guidance**: Enable automatic provisioning of the Azure Log Analytics Agent. Security center collects data from your Azure virtual machines (VMs), virtual machine scale sets, and IaaS containers (Kubernetes cluster nodes), to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats. Data is collected using the Azure Log Analytics Agent, which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your workspace for analysis. 

Data collection is required to provide visibility into missing updates, misconfigured OS security settings, endpoint protection status, and health and threat detections.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32894.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) together with Azure Security Center's Standard Tier to gain deeper visibility into your AKS nodes.
Through continuous analysis of raw security events occurring in your AKS cluster, such as network data, process creation, and the Kubernetes audit log, Security Center alerts you to threats and malicious activity detected at the host and AKS cluster level.

Determine if this activity is expected behavior or whether the application is misbehaving. Use metrics and logs in Azure Monitor to substantiate your findings. 

Use "Failed" category for SNAT Connections metric for example. ../load-balancer/load-balancer-monitor-log.md

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32898.).

**Guidance**: Kubernetes itself does not provide an identity management solution where regular user accounts and passwords are stored. Instead, external identity solutions can be integrated into Kubernetes. For AKS clusters, this integrated identity solution is Azure Active Directory. With Azure AD integration, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes resources within a namespace or across the cluster. 

You can also use the AAD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of your AKS administrative groups; reconcile access on a regular basis. You can use Azure CLI for operations such as ‘Get access credentials for a managed Kubernetes cluster’

You can use Azure CLI for operations such as ‘Get access credentials for a managed Kubernetes cluster’

Additionally, use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.

To avoid needing an Owner or Azure account administrator role, you can configure a service principal manually or use an existing service principal to authenticate ACR (Azure Container Resources) from AKS.

One of the primary user types in Kubernetes is a service account. A service account exists in, and is managed by, the Kubernetes API. The credentials for service accounts are stored as Kubernetes secrets, which allows them to be used by authorized pods to communicate with the API Server. Most API requests provide an authentication token for a service account or a normal user account.

**Guidance**: Integrate authentication for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with Azure Active Directory. Create policies and procedures around the use of dedicated administrative accounts. Use Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can be configured to use Azure Active Directory (AD) for user authentication. In this configuration, you sign in to an AKS cluster using an Azure AD authentication token. You can also configure Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to cluster resources based a user's identity or group membership.

Use Azure AD group membership to control access to namespaces and cluster resources using Kubernetes RBAC in an AKS cluster

You can interact with Kubernetes clusters using the kubectl tool. The Azure CLI provides an easy way to get the access credentials and configuration information to connect to your AKS clusters using kubectl. To limit who can get that Kubernetes configuration (kubeconfig) information and to limit the permissions they then have, you can use Azure role-based access controls (RBAC).

**Guidance**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides features that let you logically isolate teams and workloads in the same cluster. The goal should be to provide the least number of privileges, scoped to the resources each team needs. 

A namespace in Kubernetes creates a logical isolation boundary. Additional Kubernetes features and considerations for isolation and multi-tenancy include the following areas: scheduling, networking, authentication/authorization, and containers.

Additionally, you may implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. AKS clusters should be separated by virtual network/subnet, tagged appropriately, and secured within a Web Application Firewall.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32913.).

**Guidance**: To increase the security of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, restrict egress traffic to addresses, ports, and domain names that are required for your use case. 

AKS clusters are configured to pull base system container images from Microsoft Container Registry or Azure Container Registry. If you lock down the egress traffic, define specific ports and FQDNs to allow the AKS nodes to correctly communicate with required external services. Without these authorized ports and FQDNs, your AKS nodes can't communicate with the API server or install core components.
You can use Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall appliance to secure your egress traffic and define the required addresses, ports, and domain names. AKS does not automatically create these rules for you.

If using Azure Firewall, enable Diagnostic Settings to log rule matches. Use Azure Monitor Activity Log to detect changes to the Azure Firewall(s) being used to limit egress traffic on your AKS cluster(s).

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. 

To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

**Guidance**: Create an HTTPS ingress controller and use your own TLS certificates (or optionally, Let's Encrypt) for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployments.

Kubernetes egress traffic (for example, communication with the API server or downloading core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates) is encrypted by default over HTTPS/TLS.

Potentially un-encrypted egress traffic from your AKS instance may include NTP traffic, DNS traffic, and in some cases, HTTP traffic for retrieving updates.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32916.).

**Guidance**: Azure RBAC is an authorization system built on Azure Resource Manager that provides fine-grained access management of Azure resources.

Azure RBAC is designed to work on resources within your Azure subscription.
Using Azure RBAC, create a role definition that outlines the permissions to be applied. A user or group is then assigned this role definition via a role assignment for a particular scope, which could be an individual resource, a resource group, or across the subscription.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can be configured to use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for user authentication. In this configuration, you sign in to an AKS cluster using an AAD authentication token.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32920.).

**Guidance**: To monitor your Azure Container Registry (including Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances) for vulnerabilities, ensure you have Azure Security Center Standard Tier enabled. 

Enable the optional Container Registries bundle. When a new image is pushed, Security Center scans the image using a scanner from the industry-leading vulnerability scanning vendor, Qualys. When issues are found, you’ll get notified in the Security Center dashboard. 

For every vulnerability, Security Center provides actionable recommendations, along with a severity classification, and guidance for how to remediate the issue.  or details of Security Center's recommendations, see the reference list of recommendations.

There is also Azure Container Registry integration with Security Center to help protect your images and registry from vulnerabilities.

If you're on Azure Security Center's standard tier, you can add the Container Registries bundle. This optional feature brings deeper visibility into the vulnerabilities of the images in your ARM-based registries. Enable or disable the bundle at the subscription level to cover all registries in a subscription. 

This feature is charged per image, as shown on the pricing page. Enabling the Container Registries bundle, ensures that Security Center is ready to scan images that get pushed to the registry.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32921.).

**Guidance**: To protect your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, security updates are automatically applied to Linux nodes. These updates include OS security fixes or kernel updates. Some of these updates require a node reboot to complete the process. 

Note that AKS doesn't automatically reboot these Linux nodes to complete the update process.
The process to keep Windows Server nodes up to date differs from nodes running Linux. Windows Server nodes don't receive daily updates. Instead, you perform an AKS upgrade that deploys new nodes with the latest base Window Server image and patches. 

Microsoft doesn't automatically reboot worker nodes to apply OS-level patches. Although OS patches are delivered to the worker nodes, the customer is responsible for rebooting the worker nodes to apply the changes. 

Shared libraries, daemons such as solid-state hybrid drive (SSHD), and other components at the level of the system or OS are automatically patched.

Customers are responsible for executing Kubernetes upgrades. They can execute upgrades through the Azure control panel or the Azure CLI. This applies for updates that contain security or functionality improvements to Kubernetes.

**Guidance**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) itself doesn't provide an identity management solution where regular user accounts and passwords are stored. Instead, use Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the integrated identity solution for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. With Azure AD integration, you can grant users or groups access to Kubernetes resources within a namespace or across the cluster. 

Use the AAD PowerShell module to perform ad hoc queries to discover accounts that are members of your AKS administrative groups; reconcile access on a regular basis. 

Implement Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations.

**Guidance**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides features that let you logically isolate teams and workloads in the same cluster. The goal should be to provide the least number of privileges, scoped to the resources each team needs. 

A namespace in Kubernetes creates a logical isolation boundary. Additional Kubernetes features and considerations for isolation and multi-tenancy include the following areas: scheduling, networking, authentication/authorization, and containers.

Additionally, you may implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. AKS clusters should be separated by virtual network/subnet, tagged appropriately, and secured within a Web Application Firewall.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32939.).

**Guidance**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a secure service compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards. AKS clusters are deployed on host virtual machines, which run a security optimized OS. This host OS is currently based on an Ubuntu 16.04.LTS image with a set of additional security hardening steps applied (see Security hardening details). 

The goal of the security hardened host OS is to reduce the surface area of attack and allow the deployment of containers in a secure fashion.` 

AKS provides a security optimized host OS by default. There is no option to select an alternate operating system.
Azure applies daily patches (including security patches) to AKS virtual machine hosts. Some of these patches will require a reboot, while others will not. You are responsible for scheduling AKS VM host reboots as needed. For guidance on how to automate AKS patching see patching AKS nodes.

Security hardening for AKS agent node host OSAKS clusters are deployed on host virtual machines, which run a security optimized OS which is utilized for containers running on AKS.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32940.).

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using pod security policies. To improve the security of your cluster, you can limit what pods can be scheduled. Pods that request resources you don't allow can't run in the AKS cluster. You define this access using pod security policies.

In addition, you may use Azure policy [deny] and [deploy if not exist] to enforce secure settings for the Azure resources related to your AKS deployments (such as Virtual Networks, Subnets, Azure Firewalls, Storage Accounts, etc.). 

You may use Azure Policy Aliases from the following namespaces to create custom policies:

•	Microsoft.ContainerService

•	Microsoft.Network

Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ContainerService" namespace to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your AKS instances. 

Implement built-in policies. Examples of built-in policy definitions for AKS include:

> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32941.).

**Guidance**: When you create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, a control plane is automatically created and configured. This control plane is provided as a managed Azure resource abstracted from you (as the user). There's no cost for the control plane, only the nodes that are part of the AKS cluster. The managed control plane includes the 'etcd store', which is used to maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration.

Having a managed control plane means that you don't need to configure components like a highly available etcd store, but it also means that you can't access the control plane directly. Upgrades to Kubernetes are orchestrated through the Azure CLI or Azure portal, which upgrades the control plane and then the nodes.

### 7.11: Manage Azure secrets securely

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32948.).

**Guidance**: With Azure Key Vault, you store and regularly rotate secrets such as credentials, storage account keys, or certificates. You can integrate Azure Key Vault with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using a FlexVolume. The FlexVolume driver lets the AKS cluster natively retrieve credentials from Key Vault and securely provide them only to the requesting pod. Work with your cluster operator to deploy the Key Vault FlexVolume driver onto the AKS nodes. 

You can use a pod managed identity to request access to Key Vault and retrieve the credentials you need through the FlexVolume driver. Ensure Key Vault Soft Delete is enabled. 

Limit credential exposure by not defining credentials in your application code. Use managed identities for Azure resources to let your pod request access to other resources. A digital vault, such as Azure Key Vault, should also be used to store and retrieve digital keys and credentials. 

Pod managed identities is intended for use with Linux pods and container images only. (# any difference from above?)

To limit the risk of credentials being exposed in your application code, avoid the use of fixed or shared credentials. Credentials or keys shouldn't be included directly in your code. If these credentials are exposed, the application needs to be updated and redeployed. A better approach is to give pods their own identity and way to authenticate themselves, or automatically retrieve credentials from a digital vault.

A Kubernetes Secret is used to inject sensitive data into pods, such as access credentials or keys. You first create a Secret using the Kubernetes API. When you define your pod or deployment, a specific Secret can be requested. Secrets are only provided to nodes that have a scheduled pod that requires it, and the Secret is stored in tmpfs, not written to disk. When the last pod on a node that requires a Secret is deleted, the Secret is deleted from the node's tmpfs. Secrets are stored within a given namespace and can only be accessed by pods within the same namespace.

The use of Secrets reduces the sensitive information that is defined in the pod or service YAML manifest. Instead, you request the Secret stored in Kubernetes API Server as part of your YAML manifest. This approach only provides the specific pod access to the Secret. Please note: the raw secret manifest files contains the secret data in base64 format (see the official documentation for more details). Therefore, this file should be treated as sensitive information, and never committed to source control.

Kubernetes secrets are stored in etcd, a distributed key-value store. Etcd store is fully managed by AKS and data is encrypted at rest within the Azure platform.

### 7.12: Manage identities securely and automatically

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32949.).

**Guidance**: As a best practice, do not define credentials in your application code. 

Use managed identities for Azure resources to let your pod request access to other resources. A digital vault, such as Azure Key Vault, should also be used to store and retrieve digital keys and credentials. 

Pod managed identities is intended for use with Linux pods and container images only.

A managed identity for Azure resources lets a pod authenticate itself against any service in Azure that supports it, such as Azure Key Vault. The pod is assigned an Azure Identity that lets them authenticate to Azure Active Directory and receive a digital token. This digital token can be presented to other Azure services that check if the pod is authorized to access the service and perform the required actions. 

This approach means that no secrets are required for database connection strings, as an example.

Currently, an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (specifically, the Kubernetes cloud provider) requires an identity to create additional resources like load balancers and managed disks in Azure. This identity can be either a managed identity or a service principal. If you use a service principal, you must either provide one or AKS creates one on your behalf. If you use managed identity, this will be created for you by AKS automatically.

Clusters using service principals eventually reach a state in which the service principal must be renewed to keep the cluster working. Managing service principals adds complexity, which is why it's easier to use managed identities instead. The same permission requirements apply for both service principals and managed identities.

Managed identities are essentially a wrapper around service principals, and make their management simpler. Credential rotation for MI happens automatically every 46 days according to Azure Active Directory default. AKS uses both system-assigned and user-assigned managed identity types. These identities are currently immutable. To learn more, read about managed identities for Azure resources.

**Guidance**: Implement Credential Scanner to identify credentials within code. Credential Scanner will also encourage moving discovered credentials to more secure locations such as Azure Key Vault.

Limit credential exposure by not defining credentials in your application code. Use managed identities for Azure resources to let your pod request access to other resources. A digital vault, such as Azure Key Vault, should also be used to store and retrieve digital keys and credentials. 

To limit the risk of credentials being exposed in your application code, avoid the use of fixed or shared credentials. Credentials or keys shouldn't be included directly in your code. If these credentials are exposed, the application needs to be updated and redeployed. A better approach is to give pods their own identity and way to authenticate themselves, or automatically retrieve credentials from a digital vault.

Best practice guidance - Don't define credentials in your application code. Use managed identities for Azure resources to let your pod request access to other resources. A digital vault, such as Azure Key Vault, should also be

Azure Disks can use built-in snapshot technologies. You may need to look for your applications to flush writes to disk before you perform the snapshot operation. 

Velero can back up persistent volumes along with additional cluster resources and configurations. If you can't remove state from your applications, back up the data from persistent volumes and regularly test the restore operations to verify data integrity and the processes required.

If you use Azure Storage as your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application data store, prepare and test how to migrate your storage from the primary region to the backup region. 

Your applications might use Azure Storage for their data. Because your applications are spread across multiple AKS clusters in different regions, you need to keep the storage synchronized.

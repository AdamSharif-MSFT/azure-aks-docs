# Frequently asked questions about Azure Container Service (AKS)

This article addresses frequent questions about Azure Container Service (AKS).

## Which Azure regions provide the Azure Container Service (AKS) today?

- Canada Central 
- Canada East 
- Central US 
- East US 
- South East Asia 
- West Europe 
- West US 2 

## When will additional regions be added? 

Additional regions are added as demand increases.

## Are security updates applied to AKS agent nodes? 

OS security patches are applied to the nodes in your cluster on a nightly schedule, however a reboot is not performed automatically. You have several options for performing node reboots:

- Manually, through the Azure Portal or the Azure CLI. 
- By upgrading your AKS cluster. Cluster upgrades automatically [cordon and drain nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/safely-drain-node/), then bring them back up with the latest Ubuntu image. You can use this process without changing Kubernetes versions by performing an `az aks upgrade` targeting the same Kubernetes version currently on your cluster.
- Using [Kured](https://github.com/weaveworks/kured), an open-source reboot daemon for Kubernetes. Kured runs as a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) and monitors each node for the presence of a file indicating that a reboot is required. It then orchestrates those reboots across the cluster, following the same cordon and drain process described earlier.

## Do you recommend customers use ACS or AKSs? 

Given that Azure Container Service (AKS) will GA at a later date, we recommend that you build PoCâ€™s, dev and test clusters in AKS but deploy production clusters using ACS-Kubernetes or [acs-engine](https://github.com/azure/acs-engine).  

## When will ACS be deprecated? 

ACS will be deprecated around the time AKS becomes GA. You will have 12 months after that date to migrate clusters to AKS. During the 12-month period, you can run all ACS operations.

## Does AKS support node autoscaling? 

Node autoscaling is not supported but is on the roadmap. You might want to take a look at this open-sourced [autoscaling implementation][auto-scaler].

## Does AKS support Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC)?

No, RBAC is currently not supported in AKS but will be available soon.   

## Can I deploy AKS into my own virtual network?

No, this is not yet available but will be available soon.

## Is Azure Key Vault integrated with AKS? 

No, it is not but this integration is planned. In the meantime, you can try out the following solution from [Hexadite][hexadite]. 

## Why are two resource groups created with AKS? 

Each Azure Container Service (AKS) cluster is contained in two resource groups. The first is created by you and contains only the AKS resource. The second resource group is auto created during deployment and contains all cluster infrastructural resources such as VMs, networking, and storage resources. This resource group is created for easy resource cleanup. 

The auto-created resource group has a name similar to:

```
MC_myResourceGRoup_myAKSCluster_eastus
```

When adding Azure resources to be used with the Kubernetes cluster such as storage accounts or reserved public IP address, these resources need to be created in the auto created resource group.

# Monitor Azure Container Service (AKS)

Monitoring your Kubernetes cluster and containers is critical, especially when you manage a production cluster at scale with multiple apps. 

You can take advantage of several Kubernetes monitoring solutions, either from Microsoft or other providers. In this tutorial, you monitor your Kubernetes cluster using the [Containers solution for Log Analytics](../log-analytics/log-analytics-containers.md), Microsoft's cloud-based IT management solution.

This tutorial, part seven of eight, covers the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Get OMS Workspace settings
> * Set up OMS agents on the Kubernetes nodes
> * Access monitoring information in the OMS portal or Azure portal

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, an application was packaged into container images, these images uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and a Kubernetes cluster created. 

If you have not done these steps, and would like to follow along, return to [Tutorial 1 â€“ Create container images](./tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app.md).

## Configure containers solution

In the Azure portal, click *New* and search for `Container Monitoring Solution`. Once located, click on *Create*.

![Add solution](./media/container-service-tutorial-kubernetes-monitor/add-solution.png)

Create a new OMS workspace, or select an existing one. The OMS Workspace forms guide you through the process. When creating the workspace, select *Pin to dashboard* for easy retrieval.

![OMS Workspace](./media/container-service-tutorial-kubernetes-monitor/oms-workspace.png)

When done, select *Create* to create the container monitoring solution.

## Get Workspace settings

The Log analytics Worksoace ID and key are needed for configuring the solution agent on the Kubernetes nodes. To retireve these values click on 

Click on the container solution from the Azure portal dashboard.

Select *OMS Workspace*.

Select *Advanced settings*

Take note of the *Workspace ID* and the *Primary Key*.

## Set up OMS agents

The following Kuberentes manifest file can be used to configure the container monitoring solution on your Kubernertes cluster. It creates a Kubernetes [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/), which runs a single identical pod on each cluster node. The DaemonSet resource is ideal for deploying a monitoring agent. 

Save the following text to a file named `oms-daemonset.yaml`, and replace the placeholder values for *myWorkspaceID* and *myWorkspaceKey* with your log analytics Workspace ID and Key. See the [Container Monitoring Log Analytics documnetion](../log-analytics/log-analytics-containers.md) for additional installation options.

```YAML
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
 name: omsagent
spec:
 template:
  metadata:
   labels:
    app: omsagent
    agentVersion: v1.3.4-127
    dockerProviderVersion: 10.0.0-25
  spec:
   containers:
     - name: omsagent 
       image: "microsoft/oms"
       imagePullPolicy: Always
       env:
       - name: WSID
         value: myWorkspaceID
       - name: KEY 
         value: myWorkspaceKey
       - name: DOMAIN
         value: opinsights.azure.com
       securityContext:
         privileged: true
       ports:
       - containerPort: 25225
         protocol: TCP 
       - containerPort: 25224
         protocol: UDP
       volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock
          name: docker-sock
        - mountPath: /var/log 
          name: host-log
       livenessProbe:
        exec:
         command:
         - /bin/bash
         - -c
         - ps -ef | grep omsagent | grep -v "grep"
        initialDelaySeconds: 60
        periodSeconds: 60
   volumes:
    - name: docker-sock 
      hostPath:
       path: /var/run/docker.sock
    - name: host-log
      hostPath:
       path: /var/log
```

Create the DaemonSet with the following command:

```azurecli
kubectl create -f oms-daemonset.yaml
```

To see that the DaemonSet is created, run:

```azurecli
kubectl get daemonset
```

Output is similar to the following:

```azurecli
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE-SELECTOR   AGE
omsagent   3         3         3         0            3           <none>          5m
```

After the agents are running, it takes several minutes for OMS to ingest and process the data.

## Access monitoring data

In the Azure portal, go to **Log Analytics** and select your workspace name. To see the **Containers** summary tile, click **Solutions** > **Containers**. To see details, click the tile.

See the [Azure Log Analytics documentation](../log-analytics/index.yml) for detailed guidance on querying and analyzing monitoring data.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you monitored your Kubernetes cluster with OMS. Tasks covered included:

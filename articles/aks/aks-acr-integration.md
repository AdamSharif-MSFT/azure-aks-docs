# Authenticate with Azure Container Registry from Azure Kubernetes Service

When you're using Azure Container Registry (ACR) with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), an authentication mechanism needs to be established. This article details the recommended configurations for authentication between these two Azure services.

You can set up the AKS to ACR integration in a few simple commands with the Azure CLI and the aks-preview 0.4.8 extension.

## Before you begin

* You must currently be an **owner** of the **Azure subscription** to assign the appropriate roles required for the service principal
* You also need the Azure CLI version 2.0.70 or later
* You need [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your client, and you need access to [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Install latest AKS CLI preview extension

Ensure you have created and AKS cluster and added the ACR integration with the steps above.  Remove and update the AKS CLI preview extension

```console
az extension remove --name aks-preview 
az extension add -y --name aks-preview
```

## Create a new AKS cluster with ACR integration

You can set up AKS and ACR integration during the initial creation of your AKS cluster.  To allow an AKS cluster to interact with ACR, an Azure Active Directory **service principal** is used. The following CLI command creates an ACR in the resource group you specify and configures the appropriate **ACRPull** role for the service principal. If the *acr-name* does not exist, a default ACR name of `aks-<cluster-name>-acr` is automatically created.  Supply valid values for your parameters below.
```console
az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup -enable-acr [--acr <your-acr-name>]
```

Optionally, you can also specify **acr-resource-id** of an existing acr in the resource group you specified for the aks cluster with the following command.  Supply your valid values for the parameters below.
```console
az aks create -n myAKSCluster  -g myResourceGroup --enable-acr [--acr-resource-id <your-acr-resource-id>]
```

## Create ACR integration for existing AKS clusters

For existing AKS clusters you can add integration with an existing ACR. The following commands do <TODO>  You must supply valid values for **acr-name** and **acr-resource-id** or the commands will fail.

```console
az aks update -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-acr --acr <your-acr-name>
az aks create -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --enable-acr --acr-resource-id <your-acr-resource-id>
```

## Set variable and login to your ACR

Login to your ACR.

```console
acrloginservername=$(az acr show -n myAKSCluster -g myResourceGroup --query loginServer -o tsv)
az acr login -n <your-acr-name>
```

## Pull an image from docker hub and push to your ACR

```console
docker pull nginx
```

```
$ docker tag nginx $acrloginservername/nginx:v1
$ docker push someacr1.azurecr.io/nginx:v1

The push refers to repository [someacr1.azurecr.io/nginx]

```

## Update the image property for the nginx container

```console
az aks get-credentials -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster
```

View the yaml file, and edit the image property by replacing the value with your ACR login server, image, and tag.

```
$ cat acr-nginx.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx0-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx0-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx0
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: TODO <replace this image property with you acr login server, image and tag>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```


## Update the state and verify pods

You should have 2 running pods.

```
$ kubectl apply -f acr-nginx.yaml
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx0-deployment-669dfc4d4b-x74kr   1/1     Running   0          20s
nginx0-deployment-669dfc4d4b-xdpd6   1/1     Running   0          20s
```

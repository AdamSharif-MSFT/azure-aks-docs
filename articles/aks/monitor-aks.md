# Monitoring Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. This article describes the monitoring data generated by AKS and analyzed with [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview.md). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article provides basic information for getting started monitoring an AKS cluster. For complete monitoring of Kuberenetes clusters in Azure and other clouds using services such as [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](../azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md) and [Container Insights](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview.md), see [Configure Kubernetes monitoring using Azure services](../azure-monitor/containers/monitor-kubernetes-configure.md).

 ## Monitoring data 

AKS collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitor-data-from-azure-resources). See [Monitoring AKS data reference](monitor-aks-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs created by AKS. Using [other Azure services and features](#integrations), 



### Metrics
 Sources | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Platform metrics | [Platform metrics](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics) are automatically collected for AKS clusters at no cost. You can analyze these metrics with [metrics explorer](../essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) or use them for [metric alerts](../alerts/alerts-types.md#metric-alerts).  |
| Prometheus metrics | Prometheus metrics are collected by [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](../essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md) and stored in an [Azure Monitor workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). Analyze them with dashboards in [Azure Managed Grafana](../managed-grafana/overview.md). You can also create [Prometheus alerts](../azure-monitor/alerts/prometheus-alerts.md) from this data. |

### Logs
 Sources | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Activity logs | [Activity log](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md) is collected automatically for  AKS clusters at no cost. These logs track information such as when a cluster is created or has a configuration change. Send the [Activity log to a Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md#send-to-log-analytics-workspace) to analyze it with your other log data. |
| Control plane logs | [Control plane logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs) for AKS are implemented as resource logs. [Create a diagnostic setting](#collect-control-plane-logs) to send them to [Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md) where you can analyze them with log queries in [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md). |
| Container insights | Container insights collects various logs and metric data from cluster including standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) streams and stores them in a [Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md). Analyze this data with views and workbooks included with Container insights or with log queries in [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md).  |


## Collect control plane logs

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as [resource logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md) in Azure Monitor. Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations. You'll typically send them to a Log Analytics workspace, which is where the data for Container insights is stored.

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs).

AKS supports either [Azure diagnostics mode](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#azure-diagnostics-mode) or [resource-specific mode](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs.md#resource-specific-mode) for resource logs. Resource-specific mode is recommended for AKS since this sends the data to individual tables in the Log Analytics workspace. This makes the data easier to query and gives you the option of configuring the tables for [basic logs](../azure-monitor/logs/basic-logs-configure.md).

## Integrations
The following Azure services and features of Azure Monitor can be used for additional monitoring of your Kubernetes clusters. You can enable these features when you create your AKS cluster, or onboard your cluster later. Each of these features does include additional cost, so refer to the pricing information for each before you enabled them.


| Service / Feature | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Container insights](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview.md) | Uses a containerized version of the [Azure Monitor agent](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md) to collect stdout/stderr logs, performance metrics, and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster supporting a [variety of monitoring scenarios for AKS clusters](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview.md#features-of-container-insights). If you don't enable Container insights when you create your cluster, see [Enable Container insights for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks.md) for other options to enable it.<br><br>Container insights stores its data in a [Log Analytics workspace](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview.md), and you'll typically use the same one as the [resource logs](#collection-and-routing) for your cluster. See [Design a Log Analytics workspace architecture](../azure-monitor/logs/workspace-design.md) for guidance on how many workspaces you should use and where to locate them.  |
| [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](../azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md) | [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a cloud-native metrics solution from the Cloud Native Compute Foundation and the most common tool used for collecting and analyzing metric data from Kubernetes clusters. Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution in Azure. If you don't enable managed Prometheus when you create your cluster, see [Collect Prometheus metrics from an AKS cluster](../azure-monitor/essentials/prometheus-metrics-enable.md) for other options to enable it.<br><br>Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus stores its data in an [Azure Monitor workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md), which is [linked to a Grafana workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage.md#link-a-grafana-workspace) so that you can analyze the data with Azure Managed Grafana. |
| [Azure Managed Grafana](../managed-grafana/overview.md) | Fully managed implementation of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), which is an open-source data visualization platform commonly used to present Prometheus data. Multiple predefined Grafana dashboards are available for monitoring Kubernetes and full-stack troubleshooting. If you don't enable managed Grafana when you create your cluster, see [Link a Grafana workspace](../azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-manage.md#link-a-grafana-workspace) details on linking it to your Azure Monitor workspace so it can access Prometheus metrics for your cluster. |



### Sample log queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the menu for an AKS cluster, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current cluster. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other clusters or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.



### Resource logs

If the [diagnostic setting for your cluster ](#collection-and-routing) uses Azure diagnostics mode, the resource logs are stored in the [AzureDiagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics) table. You can distinguish different logs with the **Category** column. For a description of each category, see [AKS reference resource logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md).

| Description | Log query |
|:---|:---|
| API server logs | `AzureDiagnostics | where Category == "kube-apiserver"` |
| Count logs for each category | `AzureDiagnostics | where ResourceType == "MANAGEDCLUSTERS" | summarize count() by Category` |


- For a list of common queries for AKS, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](../azure-monitor/logs/queries.md#queries-interface). Select resource type **Kubernetes Services** for queries that you can load directly into Log Analytics.
- For a list of common queries for Container insights, see [Container insights queries](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-queries.md).

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview.md), [logs](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log.md), and the [activity log](../azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts.md). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.


The following table lists the recommended alert rules for AKS clusters. You can choose to automatically enable these alert rules when the cluster is created.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| | | |
| | | |

- If you enabled collection of Prometheus metrics, then you can download a collection of [recommended Prometheus alert rules](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-metric-alerts.md#enable-prometheus-alert-rules).

# Passive-cold solution overview for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

When you create an application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and choose an Azure region during resource creation, it's a single-region app. When the region becomes unavailable during a disaster, your application also becomes unavailable. If you create an identical deployment in a secondary Azure region, your application becomes less susceptible to a single-region disaster, which guarantees business continuity, and any data replication across the regions lets you recover your last application state.

This guide outlines a passive-cold solution for AKS. Within this solution, we deploy two independent and identical AKS clusters into two paired Azure regions with only one cluster actively serving traffic when the application is needed.

> [!NOTE]
> The following practice has been reviewed internally and vetted in conjunction with our Microsoft partners.

## Passive-cold solution overview

In this approach, we have two independent AKS clusters being deployed in two Azure regions. When the application is needed, we activate the passive cluster to receive traffic. If the passive cluster goes down, we must manually activate the cold cluster to take over the flow of traffic. We can set this condition through a manual input every time or a specify a certain event.

## Scenarios and configurations

This solution is best implemented as a “use as needed” workload, which is useful for scenarios that require workloads to run at specific times of day or run on demand. Example use cases for a passive-cold approach include:

- A manufacturing company that needs to run a complex and resource-intensive simulation on a large dataset. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a cloud region that offers high-performance computing and storage services. The passive cluster is only used when the simulation is triggered by the user or by a schedule. If the cluster doesn’t work upon triggering, the cold cluster can be used as a backup and the workload can run on it instead.
- A government agency that needs to maintain a backup of its critical systems and data in case of a cyber attack or natural disaster. In this case, the passive cluster is located in a secure and isolated location that’s not accessible to the public.

## Components

The passive-cold disaster recovery solution uses many Azure services. This example architecture involves the following components:

**Multiple clusters and regions**: You deploy multiple AKS clusters, each in a separate Azure region. When the app is needed, the passive cluster is activated to receive network traffic.
**Key Vault**: An [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/general/overview.md) is provisioned in each region to store secrets and keys.
**Log Analytics**: Regional [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md) instances store regional networking metrics and diagnostic logs. A shared instance stores metrics and diagnostic logs for all AKS instances.

# Access the Kubernetes API of the Fleet resource cluster with Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager

If your Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager resource was created with the hub cluster enabled, then it can be used to centrally control scenarios like Kubernetes object propagation. In this article, you learn how to access the Kubernetes API of the Fleet resource cluster.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [free trial note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

* You must have a Fleet resource with member clusters with deployed workload. If you don't have this resource, follow [Quickstart: Create a Fleet resource and join member clusters](quickstart-create-fleet-and-members.md) and [Propagate Kubernetes configurations from a Fleet resource to member clusters](resource-propagation.md).

## Access the Kubernetes API of the Fleet resource cluster

1. Get the kubeconfig file of the Fleet resource using the [`az fleet get-credentials`][az-fleet-get-credentials] command.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az fleet get-credentials --resource-group ${GROUP} --name ${FLEET}
    ```

    Your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    Merged "hub" as current context in /home/fleet/.kube/config
    ```

2. Set the following environment variable for the `id` of the Fleet resource:

    ```azurecli-interactive
    export FLEET_ID=/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets/${FLEET}
    ```

3. Authorize your identity to the Fleet resource's Kubernetes API using the following commands:

    For the `ROLE` environment variable, you can use one of the following four built-in role definitions as the value:

    * Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Reader
    * Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Writer
    * Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Admin
    * Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Cluster Admin

    ```azurecli-interactive
    export IDENTITY=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query "id" --output tsv)
    export ROLE="Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager RBAC Cluster Admin"
    az role assignment create --role "${ROLE}" --assignee ${IDENTITY} --scope ${FLEET_ID}
    ```

    Your output should be similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    {
      "canDelegate": null,
      "condition": null,
      "conditionVersion": null,
      "description": null,
      "id": "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets/<FLEET>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/<assignment>",
      "name": "<name>",
      "principalId": "<id>",
      "principalType": "User",
      "resourceGroup": "<GROUP>",
      "roleDefinitionId": "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/18ab4d3d-a1bf-4477-8ad9-8359bc988f69",
      "scope": "/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets/<FLEET>",
      "type": "Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments"
    }
    ```

4. Verify the status of the member clusters using the `kubectl get memberclusters` command.

    ```bash
    kubectl get memberclusters
    ```

    If successful, your output should look similar to the following example output:

    ```output
    NAME           JOINED   AGE
    aks-member-1   True     2m
    aks-member-2   True     2m
    aks-member-3   True     2m
    ```

## Next steps

* Review the [API specifications][fleet-apispec] for all Fleet custom resources.
* Review our [troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting-guide] to help resolve common issues related to the Fleet APIs.

## Monitor and query Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) apiserver requests

This article describes how to use [Azure Diagnostics][azure-diagnostics-overview] to enable logging for [kube-audit][kube-audit-overview] events generated by user and application activities by the [kube-apiserver][kube-apiserver-overview] component. Audit events written to the Kubernetes Audit backend are collected and forwarded to your Log Analytics workspace, where you can integrate them into queries, alerts, and visualizations with existing log data.

## Prerequisites

* A [Log Analytics workspace][log-analytics-workspace-overview]. If you already have a cluster monitored by [Container insights][container-insights-overview], you'll probably want to use that one. For more information, see [Designing your Azure Monitor Logs deployment][design-log-analytics-deployment].

## Scenario

* Monitor the requests that are coming to the API Server.
* To find which apiserver pod is serving the request.
* Which user agent is sending the request.
* What is the http method for the calls.
* Number of calls from each source.

Since AKS control plane is managed by Microsoft, the Kubernetes Audit logging is not enabled by default.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Please note that there could be substantial cost involved once kube-audit logs are enabled.
> 
> Refer to Azure Monitoring under [Azure Pricing Calculater](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/pricing/calculator/) to estimate the costs involved.
> 
> Consider disabling kube-audit logging when not required.

## Enable Kubernetes Audit Logging:

### To enable kubernetes audit logs 

Go to Diagnostic settings under Monitoring
Click on + Add diagnostic setting

### Diagnostic setting
1.  Give a name to the Diagnostic setting
2.  Select Kubernetes Audit under Categories
3.  Choose Send to Log Analytics workspace under Destination details
4.  Select the subscription for the Log Analytics workspace
5.  Choose the Log Analytics workspace to send the logs
6.  Save the settings

Once the kube-audit is enabled the data can be queried from the AzureDiagnostics table:


### Query the apiserver requests

```kusto
let starttime = datetime("2023-02-23T01:16:12.374Z");
let endtime = datetime("2023-02-24T12:16:12.374Z");
AzureDiagnostics
| where TimeGenerated between(starttime..endtime)
| where Category == "kube-audit"
| extend event = parse_json(log_s)
| extend HttpMethod = tostring(event.verb)
| extend User = tostring(event.user.username)
| extend Apiserver = pod_s
| extend SourceIP = tostring(event.sourceIPs[0])
| project TimeGenerated, Category, HttpMethod, User, Apiserver, SourceIP, OperationName, event
```

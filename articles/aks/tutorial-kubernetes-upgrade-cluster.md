# Tutorial: Upgrade Kubernetes in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

As part of the application and cluster lifecycle, you may wish to upgrade to the latest available version of Kubernetes and use new features. An Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster can be upgraded using the Azure CLI. To minimize disruption to running applications, Kubernetes nodes are carefully [cordoned and drained][kubernetes-drain] during the upgrade process.

In this tutorial, part seven of seven, a Kubernetes cluster is upgraded. You learn how to:

> * Identify current and available Kubernetes versions
> * Upgrade the Kubernetes nodes
> * Validate a successful upgrade

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, an application was packaged into a container image, this image uploaded to Azure Container Registry, and a Kubernetes cluster created. The application was then run on the Kubernetes cluster. If you have not done these steps, and would like to follow along, return to the [Tutorial 1 – Create container images][aks-tutorial-prepare-app].

This tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.38 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][azure-cli-install].

## Get available cluster versions

Before you upgrade a cluster, use the [az aks get-upgrades][] command to check which Kubernetes releases are available for upgrade:

```azurecli
az aks get-upgrades --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --output table
```

In the following example, the current node version is *1.9.6*, and the available versions are shown under the *Upgrades* column.

```
Name     ResourceGroup    MasterVersion    NodePoolVersion    Upgrades
-------  ---------------  ---------------  -----------------  ----------
default  myResourceGroup  1.9.6            1.9.6              1.10.3
```

## Upgrade a cluster

Use the [az aks upgrade][] command to upgrade the cluster nodes. The following example upgrades the cluster to version *1.10.3*.

```azurecli
az aks upgrade --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --kubernetes-version 1.10.3
```

The following condensed example output shows the *kubernetesVersion* now reports *1.10.3*:

```json
{
  "agentPoolProfiles": [
    {
      "count": 3,
      "maxPods": 110,
      "name": "nodepool1",
      "osType": "Linux",
      "storageProfile": "ManagedDisks",
      "vmSize": "Standard_DS1_v2",
    }
  ],
  "dnsPrefix": "myAKSClust-myResourceGroup-19da35",
  "enableRbac": false,
  "fqdn": "myaksclust-myresourcegroup-19da35-bd54a4be.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io",
  "id": "/subscriptions/<Subscription ID>/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster",
  "kubernetesVersion": "1.10.3",
  "location": "eastus",
  "name": "myAKSCluster",
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/ManagedClusters"
}
```

## Validate an upgrade

Confirm that the upgrade was successful with the [az aks show][] command.

```azurecli
az aks show --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --output table
```

The following example output shows the AKS cluster runs *KubernetesVersion 1.10.3*:

```
Name          Location    ResourceGroup    KubernetesVersion    ProvisioningState    Fqdn
------------  ----------  ---------------  -------------------  -------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------
myAKSCluster  eastus      myResourceGroup  1.10.3               Succeeded            myaksclust-myresourcegroup-19da35-bd54a4be.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io
```

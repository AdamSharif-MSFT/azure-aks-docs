# Update or rotate the credentials for a service principal in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

By default, AKS clusters are created with a service principal that has a one-year expiration time. As you near the expiration date, you can reset the credentials to extend the service principal for an additional period of time.

## Before you begin

You need the Azure CLI version 2.0.56 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

## Get the service principal ID

You can choose to update the existing service principal, or specify a new service principal and associated secret. If you wish to specify a different service principal ID, skip this step. If you want to update the credentials for the existing service principal, get the service principal ID of your cluster using the [az aks show][az-aks-show] command.

The following example gets the ID for the cluster named *myAKSCluster* in the *myResourceGroup* resource group. The service principal ID is set a variable for use in additional command.

```azurecli-interactive
AKS_SP=$(az aks show -g myResourceGroup -n myAKSCluster --query servicePrincipalProfile.clientId -o tsv)
```

## Update the service principal credentials

You update the credentials for an AKS cluster using the [az aks update-credentials][az-aks-update-credentials] command. The following example uses the *$AKS-SP* variable defined in the previous step for the *--service-principal* ID. If you want to specify a different service principal, provide that resource ID. Specify the new *--client-secret* for the AKS cluster to use:

```azurecli-interactive
az aks update-credentials \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --reset-service-principal \
    --service-principal $AKS_SP \
    --client-secret <new secret>
```

It takes a few moments for the service principal credentials to be updated in the AKS.

## Next steps

In this article, the service principal for the AKS cluster itself was updated. For more information on how to manage identity for workloads within a cluster, see [Best practices for authentication and authorization in AKS][best-practices-identity].

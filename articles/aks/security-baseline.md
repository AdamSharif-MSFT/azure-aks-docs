# Azure Kubernetes Service security baseline for Azure Security Benchmark

The Azure Security Baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service contains recommendations that will help you improve the security posture of your deployment.

The baseline for this service is drawn from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview), which provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure with our best practices guidance.

For more information, see [Azure Security Baselines overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/security-baselines-overview).

## Network security

*For more information, see [Security control: Network security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: With Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), you can deploy a cluster that uses one of the following two network models:

'Basic', which creates a new VNet for your cluster using default values.

'Advanced',  which allows clusters to use a new or existing VNet with customizable addresses. Application pods are connected directly to the VNet, which allows for native integration with VNet features.

A network security group filters traffic for VMs, such as the AKS nodes. As you create services, such as a Load Balancer, the Azure platform automatically configures any network security group rules that are needed. Don't manually configure network security group rules to filter traffic for pods in an AKS cluster. Define any required ports and forwarding as part of your Kubernetes Service manifests, and let the Azure platform create or update the appropriate rules.

**Responsibility**: Shared

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and network interfaces

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Use Azure Security Center and follow network protection recommendations to help secure the network resources being used by your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.  For your AKS management virtual network/subnet, enable network security group (NSG) flow logs and send logs into an Azure Storage Account for traffic audit. You may also send NSG flow logs to a Azure Log Analytics workspace and use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic flow in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Azure Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity and identify hot spots, identify security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.3: Protect critical web applications

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: To scan incoming traffic for potential attacks, use a web application firewall (WAF) such as Barracuda WAF for Azure or Azure Application Gateway to protect your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. These more advanced network resources can also route traffic beyond just HTTP and HTTPS connections or basic SSL termination.

A web application firewall (WAF) provides an additional layer of security by filtering the incoming traffic. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides a set of rules to watch for attacks like cross site scripting or cookie poisoning.

Create an Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC), a Kubernetes application, which makes it possible for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) customers to leverage Azure's native Application Gateway L7 load-balancer to expose cloud software to the Internet.

### 1.4: Deny communications with known-malicious IP addresses

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: For protections from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, Enable DDoS Standard protection on the Virtual Network your AKS components are deployed in. 

How to configure DDoS protection:
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.5: Record network packets

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Enable network security group (NSG) flog logs for the NSGs attached to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) nodes as well as any NSGs attached to subnets being used to protect your AKS service components (such as the management virtual network your web application firewall (WAF) is deployed to). Record the NSG flow logs into a Azure Storage Account to generate flow records. If required for investigating anomalous activity, enable Network Watcher packet capture.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.6: Deploy network-based intrusion detection/intrusion prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster with a web application firewall such as Barracuda WAF for Azure with Barracuda Advanced Threat Protection enabled. If intrusion detection and/or prevention based on payload inspection or behavior analytics is not a requirement, Azure Application Gateway can be used and configured in "detection mode" to log alerts and threats, or "prevention mode" to actively block detected intrusions and attacks.

### 1.8: Minimize complexity and administrative overhead of network security rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Use virtual network service tags to define network access controls on network security groups associated with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances. You can use service tags in place of specific IP addresses when creating security rules. By specifying the service tag name (e.g., ApiManagement) in the appropriate source or destination field of a rule, you can allow or deny the traffic for the corresponding service. Microsoft manages the address prefixes encompassed by the service tag and automatically updates the service tag as addresses change.

*If updating network security group (NSG) rules, make sure they are for NSGs other than the NSG that is automatically created and maintained by AKS. As a managed service, AKS has specific networking and connectivity requirements. These requirements are less flexible than requirements for normal IaaS components. In AKS, operations like customizing NSG rules, blocking a specific port (for example, using firewall rules that block outbound port 443), and white-listing URLs can make your cluster unsupportable.

### 1.9: Maintain standard security configurations for network devices

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Define and implement standard security configurations for network resources associated with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters with Azure Policy. Use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ContainerService" and "Microsoft.Network" namespaces to create custom policies to audit or enforce the network configuration of your AKS clusters. You may also make use of built-in policy definitions related to AKS, such as:

Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services

Enforce HTTPS ingress in Kubernetes cluster

Ensure services listen only on allowed ports in Kubernetes cluster

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Use tags for network security groups (NSG) and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual NSG rules, use the "Description" field to specify business need and/or duration (etc.) for any rules that allow traffic to/from a network.

Use any of the built-in Azure policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with Tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources.

You may use Azure PowerShell or Azure command-line interface (CLI) to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their Tags.

### 4.2: Isolate systems storing or processing sensitive information

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides features that let you logically isolate teams and workloads in the same cluster. The goal should be to provide the least number of privileges, scoped to the resources each team needs. A namespace in Kubernetes creates a logical isolation boundary. Additional Kubernetes features and considerations for isolation and multi-tenancy include the following areas: scheduling, networking, authentication/authorization, and containers.

Additionally, you may implement separate subscriptions and/or management groups for development, test, and production. AKS clusters should be separated by virtual network/subnet, tagged appropriately, and secured within a Web Application Firewall.

### 4.3: Monitor and block unauthorized transfer of sensitive information

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: To increase the security of your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, restrict egress traffic to addresses, ports, and domain names that are required for your use case. AKS clusters are configured to pull base system container images from Microsoft Container Registry or Azure Container Registry. If you lock down the egress traffic, define specific ports and FQDNs to allow the AKS nodes to correctly communicate with required external services. Without these authorized ports and FQDNs, your AKS nodes can't communicate with the API server or install core components.

You can use Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall appliance to secure your egress traffic and define the required addresses, ports, and domain names. AKS does not automatically create these rules for you.

If using Azure Firewall, enable Diagnostic Settings to log rule matches. Use Azure Monitor Activity Log to detect changes to the Azure Firewall(s) being used to limit egress traffic on your AKS cluster(s).

For the underlying platform which is managed by Microsoft, Microsoft treats all customer content as sensitive and goes to great lengths to guard against customer data loss and exposure. To ensure customer data within Azure remains secure, Microsoft has implemented and maintains a suite of robust data protection controls and capabilities.

**Guidance**: Create an HTTPS ingress controller and use your own TLS certificates (or optionally, Let's Encrypt) for your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deployments. 

Throughout the lifecycle of your AKS cluster, you may need to access an AKS node. You can securely access AKS nodes using SSH for nodes running Linux, or RDP for nodes running Windows Server.

Kubernetes egress traffic (for example, communication with the API server or downloading core Kubernetes cluster components and node security updates) is encrypted by default over HTTPS/TLS.

Potentially un-encrypted egress traffic from your AKS instance may include NTP traffic, DNS traffic, and in some cases, HTTP traffic for retrieving updates.

## Secure configuration

*For more information, see [Security control: Secure configuration](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-control-secure-configuration).*

### 7.1: Establish secure configurations for all Azure resources

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Secure your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using pod security policies. To improve the security of your cluster, you can limit what pods can be scheduled. Pods that request resources you don't allow can't run in the AKS cluster. You define this access using pod security policies.

In addition, you may use Azure Policy aliases in the "Microsoft.ContainerService" namespace to create custom policies to audit or enforce the configuration of your AKS instances.  You may also use built-in policies. Examples of built-in policy definitions for AKS include:

Enforce HTTPS ingress in Kubernetes cluster

Authorized IP ranges should be defined on Kubernetes Services

Based Access Control (RBAC) should be used on Kubernetes Services

Ensure only allowed container images in Kubernetes cluster

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a secure service compliant with SOC, ISO, PCI DSS, and HIPAA standards. AKS clusters are deployed on host virtual machines, which run a security optimized OS. This host OS is currently based on an Ubuntu 16.04.LTS image with a set of additional security hardening steps applied (see Security hardening details). The goal of the security hardened host OS is to reduce the surface area of attack and allow the deployment of containers in a secure fashion.

### 7.4: Maintain secure operating system configurations

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: When you create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, a control plane is automatically created and configured. This control plane is provided as a managed Azure resource abstracted from you (as the user). There's no cost for the control plane, only the nodes that are part of the AKS cluster. The managed control plane includes the 'etcd store', which is used to maintain the state of your Kubernetes cluster and configuration.

Having a managed control plane means that you don't need to configure components like a highly available etcd store, but it also means that you can't access the control plane directly. Upgrades to Kubernetes are orchestrated through the Azure CLI or Azure portal, which upgrades the control plane and then the nodes.

Secure operating system configuration is covered in detail by Azure ID 7.2; Establish secure operating system configurations.

### 7.11: Manage Azure secrets securely

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: With Azure Key Vault, you store and regularly rotate secrets such as credentials, storage account keys, or certificates. You can integrate Azure Key Vault with an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using a FlexVolume. The FlexVolume driver lets the AKS cluster natively retrieve credentials from Key Vault and securely provide them only to the requesting pod. Work with your cluster operator to deploy the Key Vault FlexVolume driver onto the AKS nodes. You can use a pod managed identity to request access to Key Vault and retrieve the credentials you need through the FlexVolume driver. Ensure Key Vault Soft Delete is enabled.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 7.12: Manage identities securely and automatically

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](None.).

**Guidance**: As a best practice, do not define credentials in your application code. Use managed identities for Azure resources to let your pod request access to other resources. A digital vault, such as Azure Key Vault, should also be used to store and retrieve digital keys and credentials. Pod managed identities is intended for use with Linux pods and container images only.

A managed identity for Azure resources lets a pod authenticate itself against any service in Azure that supports it, such as Azure Key Vault. The pod is assigned an Azure Identity that lets them authenticate to Azure Active Directory and receive a digital token. This digital token can be presented to other Azure services that check if the pod is authorized to access the service and perform the required actions. This approach means that no secrets are required for database connection strings, for example.

**Guidance**: As a best practice, back up your data using an appropriate tool for your storage type, such as Velero or Azure Site Recovery. Verify the integrity, and security, of those backups. Azure Disks can use built-in snapshot technologies. You may need to look for your applications to flush writes to disk before you perform the snapshot operation. Velero can back up persistent volumes along with additional cluster resources and configurations. If you can't remove state from your applications, back up the data from persistent volumes and regularly test the restore operations to verify data integrity and the processes required.

If you use Azure Storage as your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application data store, prepare and test how to migrate your storage from the primary region to the backup region. Your applications might use Azure Storage for their data. Because your applications are spread across multiple AKS clusters in different regions, you need to keep the storage synchronized.

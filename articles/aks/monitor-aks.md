# Monitoring Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by AKS. AKS uses [Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/overview). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource).


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article provides basic information for getting started monitoring an AKS cluster. For complete monitoring, you need to leverage other services such as [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](../essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md) and [Container Insights](container-insights-overview.md). See [Configure Kubernetes monitoring using Azure services](monitor-kubernetes-configure.md) for details on configuring these services and links to other articles for leveraging them for complete monitoring of your Kubernetes environment.

## Monitoring overview page in Azure portal

The **Monitoring** tab on the **Overview** page in the Azure portal for each AKS cluster includes graphs with common metrics for the cluster separated by node pool.

## Access Azure Monitor features

Access Azure Monitor features for all AKS clusters in your subscription from the **Monitoring** menu in the Azure portal, or for a single AKS cluster from the **Monitor** section of the **Kubernetes services** menu. The following image shows the **Monitoring** menu for your AKS cluster:

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-aks/monitoring-menu.png" alt-text="AKS Monitoring menu" lightbox="media/monitor-aks/monitoring-menu.png":::

| Menu option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Insights | Opens Container Insights for the current cluster. Select **Containers** from the **Monitor** menu to open Container Insights for all clusters.  |
| Alerts | Views alerts for the current cluster. |
| Metrics | Open metrics explorer with the scope set to the current cluster. |
| Diagnostic settings | Create diagnostic settings for the cluster to collect resource logs. |
| Advisor | Recommendations for the current cluster from Azure Advisor. |
| Logs | Open Log Analytics with the scope set to the current cluster to analyze log data and access prebuilt queries. |
| Workbooks | Open workbook gallery for Kubernetes service. |


## Container insights

Some services in Azure have special pre-built features in Azure that provide additional monitoring for the service. These features are called "insights". [Container insights](../azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-overview.md) uses a containerized version of the [Azure Monitor agent](../azure-monitor/agents/agents-overview.md) to collect stdout/stderr logs, performance metrics, and Kubernetes events from each node in your cluster. It also collects metrics from the Kubernetes control plane and stores them in the workspace. You can view the data with multiple workbooks in the Azure portal or query it using [Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview.md).


## Monitoring data 

AKS collects the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data-from-Azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring AKS data reference](monitor-aks-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by AKS.


## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Control plane logs for AKS clusters are implemented as resource logs in Azure. Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations. 

See [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](../azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the detailed process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for AKS are listed in [AKS monitoring data reference](monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs).

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for AKS with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started) for details on using this tool. 

For a list of the platform metrics collected for AKS, see [Monitoring AKS data reference metrics](monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics). For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported).


## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema) The schema for AKS resource logs is found in the [AKS Data Reference](monitor-aks-reference.md#schemas) 

The [Activity log](../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for AKS, see [Monitoring AKS data reference](monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs)  

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring AKS data reference](monitor-aks-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)  

### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the menu for an AKS cluster, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current cluster. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other clusters or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

For a list of common queries for AKS, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](../azure-monitor/logs/queries.md). 

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview.md), [logs](../azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log.md), and the [activity log](../azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts.md). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

Use [Azure Monitor Application Insights](../azure-monitor/overview#application-insights) for alerting on the 

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for [service-name].

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|

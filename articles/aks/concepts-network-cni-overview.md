# AKS CNI Networking Overview

Kubernetes uses Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugins to manage networking in Kubernetes clusters. CNIs are responsible for assigning IP addresses to pods, network routing between pods, implementing network policies, and more.

AKS provides multiple CNI plugins you can use in your clusters depending on your networking requirements.

## Networking models in AKS

Choosing a CNI plugin for your AKS cluster largely depends on which networking model fits your needs best. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages you should consider when planning your AKS cluster.

There are two main networking models used in AKS; both have multiple supported CNI plugin options. The main difference between these models is how pod IP addresses are assigned and how traffic leaves the cluster.

### Overlay networks

Overlay networking is the most common networking model used in Kubernetes. In overlay networks, pods are given an IP address from a private, logically separate CIDR from the Azure VNet subnet where AKS nodes are deployed. This allows for simpler and often better scalability than the flat network model.

In overlay networks, pods can communicate with each other directly and traffic leaving the cluster is Source Network Address Translated (SNAT'd) to the node's IP address. This means that the pod IP address is "hidden" behind the node's IP address, but this approach reduces the number of VNet IP addresses required for your clusters.

Azure Kubernetes Service provides the following CNI plugins for overlay networking:

- [Azure CNI Overlay][azure-cni-overlay], the recommended CNI plugin for most scenarios.
- [kubenet][kubenet], the legacy overlay model CNI.

### Flat networks

Unlike an overlay network, a flat network model in AKS assigns IP addresses to pods from a subnet from the same Azure VNet as the AKS nodes. This means that traffic leaving you clusters is not SNAT'd, and the pod IP address is directly exposed to the destination. This can be useful for some scenarios, such as when you need to expose pod IP addresses to external services.

> [!NOTE]
> This article is only introduces the CNI plugin options. For [Azure CNI Overlay][azure-cni-overlay], [Azure CNI VNet for dynamic IP allocation][configure-azure-cni-dynamic-ip-allocation], and [Azure CNI VNet - Static Block Allocation (Preview)][configure-azure-cni-static-block-allocation]. Please refer to their documentation instead.

Azure Kubernetes Service provides the following CNI plugins for flat networking:
- [Azure CNI Podsubnet][azure-cni-podsubnet], the recommended CNI plugin for flat networking scenarios.
- [Azure CNI Nodesubnet][azure-cni-nodesubnet], a legacy flat network model CNI.

### CNI Options in AKS

## Prerequisites

There are several requirements and considerations to keep in mind when planning your network configuration for AKS:

- The virtual network for the AKS cluster must allow outbound internet connectivity.
- AKS clusters can't use `169.254.0.0/16`, `172.30.0.0/16`, `172.31.0.0/16`, or `192.0.2.0/24` for the Kubernetes service address range, pod address range, or cluster virtual network address range.
- The cluster identity used by the AKS cluster must have at least [Network Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#network-contributor) permissions on the subnet within your virtual network. If you wish to define a [custom role](../role-based-access-control/custom-roles.md) instead of using the built-in Network Contributor role, the following permissions are required:
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action`
  - `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/read`
  - `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write`
- The subnet assigned to the AKS node pool can't be a [delegated subnet][delegated-subnet].
- AKS doesn't apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to its subnet and doesn't modify any of the NSGs associated with that subnet. If you provide your own subnet and add NSGs associated with that subnet, you must ensure the security rules in the NSGs allow traffic within the node CIDR range. For more information, see [Network security groups][aks-network-nsg].

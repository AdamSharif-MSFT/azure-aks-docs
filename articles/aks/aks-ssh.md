# SSH into Azure Container Service (AKS) cluster nodes

Occasionally, you may need to access an Azure Container Service (AKS) node for maintenance, log collection, or other troubleshooting operations. Azure Container Service (AKS) nodes are not exposed to the internet. Use the steps detailed in this document to create an SSH connection with an AKS node.

## Get AKS node address

Get the ip address of the AKS cluster nodes using the `az vm list-ip-addresses` command. Replace the resource group name with the name of your AKS resource group.

```console
$ az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group MC_myAKSCluster_myAKSCluster_eastus -o table

VirtualMachine            PrivateIPAddresses
------------------------  --------------------
aks-nodepool1-42032720-0  10.240.0.6
aks-nodepool1-42032720-1  10.240.0.5
aks-nodepool1-42032720-2  10.240.0.4
```

## Configure SSH access

Copy your SSH key to the host clip board. The following example uses `pbcopy`, any method can be used.

```console
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | pbcopy
```

Run the `aks-ssh` container image, which will create a pod on one of the AKS cluster nodes. The `aks-ssh` image has been created from the debian image and includes vim and an SSH client.

```console
kubectl run -it --rm aks-ssh --image=debian
```

Install an SSH client and text editor.

```console
apt-get update
apt-get install openssh-client
spt-get install vim
```

Once attached to the running container, create a file named `id_rsa` and copy into it the contents of the clipboard. Save the file when done.

```console
vi id_rsa
```

Modify the `id_rsa` file so that it is user read-only.

```console
chmod 0600 id_rsa
```

## Create the ssh connection.

Now create an SSH connection to any AKS node. The default user name for an AKS cluster is `azureuser`. If this account was changed at cluster creation time, substitute the proper admin user name.

```console
$ ssh -i id_rsa azureuser@10.240.0.6

azureuser@aks-nodepool1-42032720-0:~$
```

## Remove SSH access

When done, exit the SSH session and then the interactive container session. This action deletes the SSH pod from the AKS cluster.

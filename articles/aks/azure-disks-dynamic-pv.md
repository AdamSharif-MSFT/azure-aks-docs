# Persistent volumes with Azure disks

A persistent volume represents a piece of storage that has been provisioned for use with Kubernetes pods. A persistent volume can be used by one or many pods and can be dynamically or statically provisioned. For more information on Kubernetes persistent volumes, see [Kubernetes persistent volumes][kubernetes-volumes].

This document details using persistent volumes to dynamically create an Azure disk for used with AKS pods.

## Built in storage classes

A storage class is used to define how a dynamically created persistent volume is configured. For more information on Kubernetes storage classes, see [Kubernetes Storage Classes][kubernetes-storage-classes].

Each AKS cluster includes two pre-created storage classes, both configured to work with Azure disks. Use the [kubectl get storageclass][kubectl-get] command to see these.

```console
NAME                PROVISIONER                AGE
default (default)   kubernetes.io/azure-disk   1h
managed-premium     kubernetes.io/azure-disk   1h
```

The `default` storage class provisions a standard Azure disk. The `managed-premium` storage class provisions a premium Azure disk.

## Create persistent volume claim

When using an Azure disk, a persistent volume claim can be used to automatically create a disk that can then be mounted in a pod. The disk is created in the same resource group as the AKS resources.

This example manifest creates a persistent volume claim using the `managed-premium` storage class, to create a disk `5GB` in size with `ReadWriteOnce` access. For more information on PVC access modes, see [Access Modes][access-modes].

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: azure-managed-disk
  annotations:
    volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: managed-premium
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
```

> [!NOTE]
> An Azure disk can only be mounted with Access mode type ReadWriteOnce, which makes it available to only a single AKS node. If needing to share a persistent volume across multiple nodes, consider using [Azure Files][azure-files-pvc].

## Using the persistent volume

Once the persistent volume claim has been created, and the disk successfully provisioned, a pod can be created with access to the disk. The following manifest creates a pod that uses the persistent volume claim `azure-managed-disk` to mount the Azure disk at the `/var/www/html` path. 

```yaml
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: myfrontend
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
        name: volume
  volumes:
    - name: volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: azure-managed-disk
```

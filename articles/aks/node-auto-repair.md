# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node auto-repair

AKS continuously checks the health state of worker nodes and performs automatic repair of the nodes if they become unhealthy.

## Region Availability

This feature is available in all regions where AKS is supported.

## How AKS checks for unhealthy nodes

> [!Note]
> AKS takes repair action on nodes with the user account **aks-remediator**.

AKS uses rules to determine if a node is an unhealthy state and needs repair. AKS uses the following rules to determine if automatic repair is needed.

* The node reports status of **NotReady** on consecutive checks within a 10-minute timeframe
* The node doesn't report a status within 10 minutes

You can manually check the health state of your nodes with kubectl. 

```
kubectl get nodes
```

## How automatic repair works

Auto-repair takes several steps to repair a broken node.  If a node is determined to be unhealthy, AKS uses the following remediation steps:

* The node is rebooted
* If a reboot doesn't fix the node, the node is replaced with a new node
* If multiple nodes are unhealthy, they are repaired one by one

## Next steps

Use [Availability Zones][availability-zones] to increase high availability with your AKS cluster workloads.

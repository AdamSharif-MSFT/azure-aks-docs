# AKS Diagnostics overview

Sometimes good clusters can go through bad times. Cluster issues can be dreadful especially When running mission critical workloads. AKS Diagnostics is an intelligent self-diagnostic experience to help you identify and resolve problems in your cluster. This cloud-native offering will help you find the issue of your cluster and guide you to the right information to easily and quickly troubleshoot the issue with no extra configuration and billing cost.

## Open AKS Diagnostics

After you choose to investigate the issue by clicking on a category, you can view cluster-specific diagnostic metrics related to the topic often supplemented with textual description of the issue, recommended actions with links to helpful docs, and logging data. Diagnostic reports are generated intelligently based on the current state of your cluster after running variety of checks and can be a powerful tool for pinpointing the problem of your cluster and finding the next steps to resolve the issue.

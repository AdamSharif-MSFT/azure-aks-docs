# Integrate with Azure-managed services using Open Service Broker for Azure (OSBA)

Together with the [Kubernetes Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog), Open Service Broker for Azure (OSBA) allows developers to utilize Azure-managed services in Kubernetes. This guide focuses on deploying Kubernetes Service Catalog, Open Service Broker for Azure (OSBA), and applications that use Azure-managed services using Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription

* Azure CLI 2.0: You can [install it locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) or use it in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview)

* Helm CLI 2.7+: You can [install it locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm#install-helm-cli) or use it in the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview)

* Permissions to create a service principal with the Contributor role on your Azure subscription

* Creating an Azure Container Service (AKS) cluster

Let's get started by deploying an Azure Container Service (AKS) cluster. You can follow the [Create an AKS cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough) quickstart guide.

## Installing Service Catalog

Next step is to install service catalog using Helm chart. Refer to [Install Helm CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-helm#install-helm-cli) for Helm installation.
Download and install Helm CLI 2.7.2+ in your local environment, and upgrade your Tiller (Helm server) installation with:

```azurecli-interactive
helm init --upgrade
```

Adding the service catalog chart Helm repository:

```azurecli-interactive
helm repo add svc-cat https://svc-catalog-charts.storage.googleapis.com
```

Installing service catalog from Helm chart:

```azurecli-interactive
helm install svc-cat/catalog \
    --name catalog --namespace catalog --set rbacEnable=false
```

After, you install the Helm chart, you should see service catalog in:

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get apiservice
```

## Installing Open Service Broker for Azure

Next step is to install [Open Service Broker for Azure](https://github.com/Azure/open-service-broker-azure), which includes the catalog for the Azure-managed services. Examples for available Azure services are Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Redis Cache, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL Database, and others.

Let's startÂ by adding Open Service Broker for Azure Helm repository:

```azurecli-interactive
helm repo add azure https://kubernetescharts.blob.core.windows.net/azure
```

Create a [Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-service-principal) using:

```azurecli-interactive
az ad sp create-for-rbac --skip-assignment
```

Output looks something like the example below, `appId`, `password` and `tenant` values are used in the next step.

```
{
  "appId": "7248f250-0000-0000-0000-dbdeb8400d85",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2017-10-15-02-20-15",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2017-10-15-02-20-15",
  "password": "77851d2c-0000-0000-0000-cb3ebc97975a",
  "tenant": "72f988bf-0000-0000-0000-2d7cd011db47"
}
```

Setting up environment variables with the preceding values:

```azurecli-interactive
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=[your Azure appId from above]
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=[your Azure password from above]
AZURE_TENANT_ID=[your Azure tenant from above]
```

and get subscription ID using:
```azurecli-interactive
az account show --query id -o tsv
```

Setting up environment variable with the preceding value:

```azurecli-interactive
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=[your Azure subscription ID from above]
```

Installing Open Service Broker for Azure using Helm chart:

```azurecli-interactive
helm install azure/open-service-broker-azure --name osba --namespace osba \
    --set azure.subscriptionId=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
    --set azure.tenantId=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
    --set azure.clientId=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
    --set azure.clientSecret=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Let's install the [Service Catalog CLI](https://github.com/Azure/service-catalog-cli) for easy-to-use command line interface for querying service brokers, service classes, service plans and more.

Installing Service Catalog CLI binary:

```azurecli-interactive
curl -sLO https://servicecatalogcli.blob.core.windows.net/cli/latest/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/svcat
chmod +x ./svcat
mv ./svcat /usr/local/bin/
```

Listing installed service brokers:

```azurecli-interactive
svcat get brokers
```

Listing service classes. These are the available Azure-managed services that can be provisioned through Open Service Broker for Azure.

```azurecli-interactive
svcat get classes
```

Finally, listing all available service plans. These are the service tiers for the Azure-managed services. For example, for Azure Database for MySQL, this ranges from `basic50` for Basic Tier with 50 Database Transaction Units (DTUs) to `standard800` for Standard Tier with 800 DTUs.

```azurecli-interactive
svcat get plans
```

## Installing WordPress from Helm chart using Azure Database for MySQL

This command uses Helm to install an updated Helm chart of WordPress that provisions an external Azure Database for MySQL instance in order to have WordPress use it. This process can take a few minutes.

Please refer to the [Azure/helm-charts](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts) repo to access other updated osba-based helm charts and for more details steps of how you can update your own helm charts to integrate with OSBA.

```azurecli-interactive
helm install azure/wordpress --name wordpress --namespace wordpress
```

In order to verify the installation has provisioned the right resources:

List installed service instances and bindings:

```azurecli-interactive
svcat get instances -n wordpress
svcat get bindings -n wordpress
```

List installed secrets:

```azurecli-interactive
kubectl get secrets -n wordpress -o yaml
```

If you are interested in creating your own charts that work with the Open Service Broker for Azure, please refer to [Creating a New Chart](https://github.com/Azure/helm-charts#creating-a-new-chart).

## Summary

This guide showed how to install Service Catalog to an Azure Container Service (AKS) cluster, how to deploy Open Service Broker for Azure and deploy an application, such as WordPress, that is using Azure-managed services, in this case Azure Database for MySQL.

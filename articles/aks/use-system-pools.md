# Manage system node pools in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), nodes of the same configuration are grouped together into *node pools*. System node pools and user node pools are two different node pool modes for your AKS clusters. The node pools modes are mutable. User node pools are where you place your application-specific pods. Node pools contain the underlying VMs that run your applications. Every AKS cluster must contain at least one system node pool with at least one node. If you run a single system node pool for your AKS cluster, we recommend you use at least three nodes for the node pool. To support applications that have different compute or storage demands, you can create additional user node pools. For example, use additional node pools to provide GPUs for compute-intensive applications, or access to high-performance SSD storage. 

## Before you begin

* API version of `2020-03-01` or greater
* You need the Azure CLI version 2.3.1 or later installed and configured. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI][install-azure-cli].

## Limitations

The following limitations apply when you create and manage AKS clusters that support system node pools.

* See [Quotas, virtual machine size restrictions, and region availability in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)][quotas-skus-regions].
* The AKS cluster must be built with virtual machine scale sets as the VM type.
* The name of a node pool may only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and must begin with a lowercase letter. For Linux node pools, the length must be between 1 and 12 characters. For Windows node pools, the length must be between 1 and 6 characters.

## System and user node pools

System node pool nodes each have the label **kubernetes.azure.com/mode: system**. Every AKS cluster contains at least one system node pool, and every system node pool contains at least one node. User node pools may contain zero or more nodes.

* You can update a system node pool to be a user node pool.
* You can update a user node pool to be a system node pool.
* You can delete system node pools, provided you have another system node pool to take its place in the AKS cluster.
* An AKS cluster may have multiple system node pools, and requires at least one system node pool.

## Create a new AKS cluster with a system node pool

When you create a new AKS cluster, you automatically create a system node pool with a single node. The initial node pool defaults to a mode  of system. When you create additional node pools with az aks nodepool add, those node pools are user node pools unless you explicitly specify the mode parameter.

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* region.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Use the [az aks create][az-aks-create] command to create an AKS cluster. The following example creates a cluster named *myAKSCluster* with one system pool containing one node. For your production workloads, ensure you are using system node pools with at least three nodes. This operation may take several minutes to complete.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks create -g myResourceGroup --name myAKSCluster --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Add a system node pool to an existing AKS cluster

You can add one or more system node pools to existing AKS clusters. The following command adds a node pool of mode system with a default count of three nodes.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool add -g myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster -n mynodepool --mode system
```
## Show details for node pools

You can check the details of your node pools with the following command.  

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool show -g myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster -n mynodepool
```

You see an output similar to the below, and you can check the mode for your node pool. A mode of **System** is defined for system node pools, and a mode of **User** is defined for user node pools.

```output
{
  "agentPoolType": "VirtualMachineScaleSets",
  "availabilityZones": null,
  "count": 3,
  "enableAutoScaling": null,
  "enableNodePublicIp": false,
  "id": "/subscriptions/666d66d8-1e43-4136-be25-f25bb5de5883/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/myAKSCluster/agentPools/mynodepool",
  "maxCount": null,
  "maxPods": 110,
  "minCount": null,
  "mode": "System",
  "name": "mynodepool",
  "nodeLabels": {},
  "nodeTaints": null,
  "orchestratorVersion": "1.15.10",
  "osDiskSizeGb": 100,
  "osType": "Linux",
  "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "scaleSetEvictionPolicy": null,
  "scaleSetPriority": null,
  "spotMaxPrice": null,
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.ContainerService/managedClusters/agentPools",
  "vmSize": "Standard_DS2_v2",
  "vnetSubnetId": null
}
```

## Update system and user node pools

You can change modes for both system and user node pools. You can change a system node pool to a user pool only if another system node pool already exists on the AKS cluster.

This command changes a system node pool to a user node pool.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool update -g myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster -n mynodepool --mode user
```

This command changes a user node pool to a system node pool.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool update -g myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster -n mynodepool --mode system
```

## Delete a system node pool

> [!Note]
> To use system node pools on AKS clusters prior to API version 2020-03-01, add a new system node pool, then delete the original default node pool.

Previously you could not delete the initial default node pool in an AKS cluster. With system node pools, you have the flexibility to delete any node pool from your clusters. You need to ensure you have at least two system node pools so you can delete one of them.

```azurecli-interactive
az aks nodepool delete -g myResourceGroup --cluster-name myAKSCluster -n mynodepool
```
